1
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,137
the morning

2
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:19,040
the debugging an ex got six so he got

3
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:23,006
say now debugging session last year you
have notice our quest to bring more

4
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,069
relevant ebuddy information to your
fingertips this year we look we're going

5
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,232
to continue with this mission

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,920
up quite forget my colleague reminded me
to introduce myself

7
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:35,871
but my name is not change from last year
some still hanging on

8
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:40,820
have stood by you I engineer sup

9
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,751
let's look briefly look at what we're
going to talk about

10
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,330
this year I'm gonna talk about a new
feature in tax cuts 6

11
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:53,101
that will help you with debugging y'all
use of Grand Central Dispatch

12
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,540
which is TCD its teachers call

13
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,621
cutie bugging makes up Tristano come up

14
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,308
show you amazing new way to explore and
you but your user interface

15
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,520
and then carries gonna talk in detail
how to integrate

16
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:12,069
y'all the criminal preview into your
custom class

17
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:18,075
I want to set the stage for a cutie
bugging

18
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:21,150
so that we on the same page my apologies
the

19
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:25,024
this is a vid love it too basic for some
love you but

20
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,160
is important that we get the
fundamentals right so

21
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:33,011
where and application hits a break point
a

22
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:36,161
the program pas the debugger will go
through a process known as

23
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:42,078
unwinding what it does is looks at the
method it contains a break point

24
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,082
and follows the prank 3-pointer back to
the call flight

25
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:51,110
in this case away from that it goes on
until they were just the beginning of

26
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:52,068
the threat

27
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:55,082
then contact with a series of stacked
frames

28
00:01:55,082 --> 00:02:01,099
known as a back trace so spectrum is an
instance other invocation other method

29
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:05,588
now back to resign port because you
helps you understand the control-flow

30
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,920
and the state of the application so what
happens

31
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,181
all how does the city impact that traces

32
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:17,088
but first what is GCT it is a

33
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:21,143
technology that is introduced five or
six years ago

34
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:26,111
I it's not at the time frame as since
then has taken off like wildfire

35
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:30,060
because it is a very natural way to

36
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:34,090
create concurrent responsive application
basically you

37
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:38,099
evening bag a task up in the smaller
work items

38
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,158
call blocks and then UN cue the block

39
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:45,089
2aq using two weeks

40
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:48,143
synchronously or a synchronously

41
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:53,712
we're going to focus on the latter
because it poses a bigger challenge

42
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,520
when it comes to debug UN Cuate
synchronously using

43
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:04,056
the dispatch a sink ATI and then

44
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:07,118
what you're telling the system the OS's
at some time later

45
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,018
it can be Q ya block

46
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:14,022
and final work attracted to start
executing it

47
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:17,038
imagine that you've had a break point

48
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:21,134
your blog right now so let's look at the
back trace

49
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:25,105
of track 16 of the debugger

50
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,007
has finished unwinding the bottom all
spring

51
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:32,117
39 represents the start of the work a
threat

52
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:36,036
which corresponds to the deep healing
you that

53
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:40,040
so what do you have to do to understand
the control flow before the and healing

54
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:40,130
event

55
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:47,042
well what I used to do is to find the
math that that contains the and CUNY ban

56
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,151
in this case cash crop image pasted in
the session every year

57
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:55,053
search for all the calls I saw that put
break points there

58
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:59,622
relaunch the application go through all
the crazy you I gestures

59
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,800
to make sure I can repeat the up
something looks the same problem

60
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:08,008
the hit the break point and heaven
forbid save

61
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:11,087
North call sites also in another respect

62
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,640
a sink because them insight to wash
rinse and repeat

63
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:21,433
but Xcode is not lying to you when it's
giving you this limited

64
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,830
that trace that's because the trip the
thread that does and queuing

65
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,232
did it a synchronously in the past

66
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,979
in fact that threat is possibly doing
something completely different

67
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,770
on may be gone from memory so it's not
bad to

68
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:42,476
accuse anybody of not being being able
to unwind to the past

69
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,241
but in your head must be thinking well
this is accurate but

70
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,985
surely expert can present a more logical
back trace

71
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:56,120
and we agree with you saw

72
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:59,311
in the scenario that i described above

73
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:05,210
earlier we're going to splice in actual
sex is gonna splice in the back trace

74
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:09,280
of the ensuing event so they can show
them to you in a

75
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,485
in a more logical manner in the UI

76
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,642
any get one what one am more than one
including events

77
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,759
Xcode is gonna follow the chain so they
show you everything

78
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,555
so how do we do that while we work
through several years of the OS

79
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:32,767
down to the car West we try cause all
the factories is

80
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,386
of the ensuing events so when your
application has a break point

81
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,520
exco to us the debugger do we treat the
back trace

82
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:44,481
so that we can show them to you in the
UI

83
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,520
the life that frames they have colored
icons

84
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:52,601
the wreck on a stack frames the angry
icons but

85
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,157
just like the livestock friend you can
select

86
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,021
you get elected and effects but has the
buck symbols

87
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,744
it was you will surely the Southport
again this case

88
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,461
if it doesn't have the votes in Bali
will show you this assembly that some

89
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,934
among us can actually decipher

90
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,808
so what why and icons gray ball

91
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,680
a wreck on us that brings icon is great
because it is a visual cue

92
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:25,149
to let you know that its historical

93
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:30,698
and because it doesn't exist in memory
anymore you cannot interact with that

94
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,200
in the console he cannot run expressions
like peel

95
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:38,815
next call when I show you the its spring
variables because recording

96
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:43,481
the frame parables would cause the
application to plot out in memory

97
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:48,680
possibly causing it to be jetsam on the
device

98
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:51,127
so that wraps up the first part of you
debugging

99
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:55,356
lean on to the second part

100
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,599
axle body for shows you the back traces

101
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,627
in the threads view in the back have a
gator

102
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,913
as you can see here press five threat by
showing it

103
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:09,292
showing you respect race so that just
means that affect races all organized by

104
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:10,580
his parents

105
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:14,627
threats that's another equally
interesting views known as

106
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,240
Hughes view in the back navigator and
you pay attention to your top right

107
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:22,373
corner that's a little control known as

108
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:25,634
the process view options collector

109
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,039
it is a mouthful that is useful

110
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,073
so huge you toggle it to the Q view

111
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,384
experts which issue over to emphasize
the relationship between blocks

112
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:41,440
and Q's so

113
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,552
in this slight here you see that a top
he has won executing block

114
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,800
so what about the blocks that yet you
have thank you

115
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:54,617
but not executing it let's look at this
scenario

116
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,461
so I'm using a serial key US an
illustration but

117
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:01,993
this happens with concurrent use as well

118
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,860
we square is your currently executing
block

119
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:10,115
as long as it's not finished executing

120
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,941
blocks the summit's summit subsequently
to the key will get stacked up behind it

121
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,418
we call this great quest the pending
blocks

122
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,567
Sonex buttsex we're gonna show you

123
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:31,179
the pending blocks as well the Q

124
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,200
so in this case we have nine pending
blocks

125
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:38,095
the pending love select X unlike the
executing block in that you press the

126
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,106
down

127
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:45,043
it will show you the is Rep back choice
which by definition is a wreck on a back

128
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:45,082
trace

129
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:49,176
a bank unions so we hope that by so
facing this information you can answer

130
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,084
questions

131
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:55,127
like how many pending blocks have I
similar to the Q

132
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:59,027
MI over saturating the Q

133
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:03,028
and you can literally tens and thousands
a block spending blocks

134
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:07,078
out there some that are not needed

135
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,171
because you may be able to change all
going down all your

136
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,071
granularity so that you do less work

137
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,129
i doing that's what is important because
that would mean saving battery life on

138
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:18,095
your customers

139
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:22,136
devices on top of that will help us
solve

140
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:26,038
a class of programming problems

141
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:29,097
that I'm going to go into a
demonstration now

142
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:32,160
so running on a simulator is an
application called jogger

143
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,104
which helps you track your runs in San
Francisco

144
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:41,152
and keep said while you at you doing
this to be the BBC

145
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:47,111
by know about jogging in keeping fit we
can all dream

146
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:51,049
out live a time I get that tracks the RI
time

147
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:55,058
annual velocity and

148
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:58,070
a map of all the route that I've done

149
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:01,030
and I've done exactly one this year

150
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:04,098
which is one too many gonna

151
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:08,112
if you click on the date you selected
date you all flight into detail page

152
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:13,035
of my velocity crop some notice that

153
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:17,109
it takes a little time to the slide into
detail page

154
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,063
and I'm sure you have learned from Apple
and develop help customers that

155
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:24,072
the one you any nation to be sloth small

156
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:28,159
like butter so this is not

157
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,065
and I want to figure out why so since I
know to cook really well under

158
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,035
just gonna jump straight into Xcode to
the class known as

159
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:42,054
graph you crap you is the class the draw
the graph

160
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:45,097
and I'm gone James I'm gonna jump
straight to a week from net by going to

161
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:47,115
the implementation feel of the John Barr

162
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:52,046
and start typing awake bag up

163
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:56,067
and i've a method jail here that creates
my velocity path

164
00:10:56,067 --> 00:11:00,105
and I know that is doing a lot of
heavy-duty work so let's jump in

165
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:04,048
to the definition by doing a command
click on it

166
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:08,054
but I see here as is spending time
fetching the velocity data from the

167
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:09,105
database

168
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:14,102
and that it takes a lock to protect it

169
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:19,043
and subsequently go through each data
point that velocity data

170
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:24,052
to draw that the path and when is done
releases the lock

171
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:27,140
so doing all this work on the main
threat so is impeding

172
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:31,005
detail page from sliding and this

173
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:34,103
looks like a good candidate to use
artist a defect a sink

174
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:41,066
so let's do that going back to away from
that

175
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:44,100
and I'm gonna pacing that place in a
chunk of code

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
which I don't have alright

177
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:09,090
alright I'm gonna move the line that
creates the the path

178
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:14,091
into the dispatch facing block I'm gonna
dispatched to block to a simple Q

179
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:18,171
of the graph and i'm don calculating the
path

180
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:24,078
our updated on the main threat but usual
so this is a free doesn't pretty simple

181
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:24,141
change

182
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,084
that's three run by clicking on a run
but in to see that works

183
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:35,084
ok am going to go to the

184
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,154
date second selected so this time

185
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:44,116
when I when I select the date

186
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:51,099
detail page the slide in very quickly
Richard us

187
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:54,117
but my graph is not drawing

188
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:59,091
cell that them anyways don't you can

189
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:03,106
try to figure out what is the problem
but one of my favorite way is to look at

190
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:05,053
the speed up the application

191
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:08,061
and to do that and you know I will look
at the back traces

192
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:11,116
of the application by clicking

193
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:19,016
be pause button in the debug bar and I
know that

194
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:22,117
want for my grad is down on the grass 0q
site farm

195
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:29,025
found a threat which is threatening to
interested open

196
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:32,054
and is it

197
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:35,106
you name it may not be this year to back
but frame to

198
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:40,035
shows that I'm trying to wait for lock
looks like it

199
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:43,090
minutes like bring three to come from it

200
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,063
and indeed I'm waiting for the lock so
those of us who have faced

201
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:50,076
this situation before half have a pretty
standard

202
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:54,155
following path: as that which is to find
a thread that has the lock

203
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:59,069
so let's do that Michigan if the way to

204
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:02,106
show all the back to recess which which
is due first

205
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:07,104
collapse be a process item and by
holding down the option key

206
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:13,013
you can twist it open Sonam than a
visually just and through

207
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:19,058
to look for the threat that has the lock
well this is interesting because the

208
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,137
sites that

209
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:23,118
threat 22 which is trying to acquire the
lock

210
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:27,049
I cannot find a threat that has the lock

211
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:32,106
so this is a head-scratcher but what do
you know I'm just learned something that

212
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,013
may be able to help us

213
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:37,019
summit is situated cutie bugging by
going to the

214
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:42,081
that control and here I'm going to use
the

215
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:47,076
filter bach to focus on lie crop sale Q

216
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:52,079
so that s cell

217
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,088
is safe here I'm one running block which
is

218
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:58,096
my the law the block waiting for the
lock

219
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:02,099
and I one pending block

220
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:05,128
to show my pending lock I'm gonna go to
ninety Batman widan

221
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:11,051
about workflow and turn on I wish
opening blocking cues

222
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:14,136
by out pop my pending block

223
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:18,067
minute twisted open and select the first
frame

224
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:24,080
which espy sauce court subplot a
celebration drop kar

225
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:28,012
is a method which enhanced this morning
as well to use dispatch

226
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:31,145
a sink so that can to work of the main
track

227
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:35,080
and looks like in my haste what I did is

228
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:38,015
I acquire the lock before I did the
dispatch

229
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:42,154
a sink so what's going on is this

230
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:47,108
I had an execution block waiting for
lock

231
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:51,073
and SPECT right after it is my pending
block

232
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:54,104
which unfortunately has the lock so

233
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:59,012
the pending block cannot move because
has to wait for the execution block to

234
00:15:59,012 --> 00:15:59,069
finish

235
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:02,143
so this is the kind of a deadlock

236
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:07,096
albeit in and non-classical way so

237
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:10,195
thankfully the solution is pretty simple
I just have to move the line that does

238
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:11,163
the locking

239
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:16,064
closer to the place ways protecting

240
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:19,079
its data which is full of the media to

241
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:24,079
this ensures that it doesn't try to get
the lock

242
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,084
and killers dq and start executing

243
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:31,141
cell with this second round of simple
change

244
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:39,041
receive this works

245
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:47,910
okay let's get to the point where I can
select the date again and walla

246
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,703
everything looks correct now so

247
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,490
without it cue debugging what you would
have to do what I would have to do is to

248
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,061
such follow the places where I

249
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,097
my velocity did a lot of issues and
usually look at them and

250
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:07,191
reason really hot about house used and
that error prone and tedious

251
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:11,178
in summary you're gonna get cue
debugging an expert thinks

252
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,113
which has two parts: record a back
traces gonna get you

253
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:21,039
show you back trace all me and healing
if and when you're using effect you

254
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,088
think

255
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:25,377
and pending blocks Bice hopefully bicep
basing this

256
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:29,990
information you all can optimize the use
of GC

257
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,124
with that many bring up try to talk
about unibody

258
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:40,024
here

259
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:43,012
hi my name is Troy and thank you for
coming to our

260
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:50,004
debugging and Xcode 6 as you may know
Xcode is a fantastic tool

261
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:53,048
for discovering things about your
application they may be hidden

262
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:57,115
through the debug humming just should
have two new features through the

263
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,028
pending blocks and recorded I stack
traces that are

264
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:06,083
hitting pieces of information about your
application that Xcode X 160

265
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,095
we all know that not all the bugs

266
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:13,098
in applications are hid some of them are
extremely visible there staring us right

267
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:13,180
in the face

268
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:18,016
from the user if a server applications
and since these are visual bugs

269
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:22,019
wouldn't it be great if we could do but
then visually as well

270
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:27,117
and now an extra tix you can so it kinda
bugs in my talking about

271
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:32,019
these are the bugs were you have I miss
position viewer clipping is wrong

272
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:35,073
he's a very squish through the stretch
news

273
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:38,110
and these are the views that are missing
entirely because the visibility or

274
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:45,007
is hidden attribute is set incorrectly
in your application but

275
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:49,061
that's not all that this I knew aspect
to the debugger an extra helps with

276
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:53,095
you can use it when you're not even to
bucking it's an application like this

277
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,100
and I would like to add a new button
down here

278
00:18:57,045 --> 00:19:00,053
and

279
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:05,079
I don't know maybe its new code base to
me maybe it's been awhile since I've

280
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,117
read this

281
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:12,046
I don't know what this view is behind a
wouldn't it be great if I could just

282
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:14,072
click with the mouse and find out what
that you it's

283
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:17,126
well now you can't this

284
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:21,030
YouTube under featured integrated all
throughout exco

285
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:25,012
so let's take a look at the expo window
and figure out where the different

286
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:25,115
pieces are

287
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:29,038
so we know what we're talking about
where talk about this

288
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,109
YouTube and the future here's the Xcode
whenever we all know and love

289
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:36,082
we application is running down at the
bottom there's

290
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:40,156
body but by this is where you fine I you
familiar items such as baked pies and

291
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:41,065
continue buttons

292
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:45,064
well now there's a new button here which
is the debug

293
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:48,143
you hire keeping right here simply click
this

294
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:53,091
and exclude is going to import the user
interface if your application

295
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:57,142
into the main editor window X ca but
it's not just

296
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:01,051
imported as a static image if imported

297
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:05,124
separate pieces so that exco can
actually exploded out into three

298
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:06,100
dimensions

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,046
and rotated around if you want senior

300
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:14,051
your application in this 3d view is very
illuminating and allows you to

301
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:18,104
at traverse the hair DC with a parent
views RC with the siblings are

302
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:22,121
but if you want a more concrete
representation I V view hierarchy

303
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:29,059
we turn to the debug navigator this is
as high maint at about the place we find

304
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,081
your threads on your tears

305
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:33,106
at available here in this

306
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:38,015
I process few options selector if you
select

307
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:42,101
the view option in there now is three
excuse abuse down below we have

308
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:49,025
the your view hierarchy in the
application which is right here

309
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:54,050
down below we have some filtering
options to help you

310
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:58,060
team that list we have a show only
primary views and we have a show only

311
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:00,012
displayed here from a stop on earth

312
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:03,108
second one because this was important if
you have a view that's missing in your

313
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:04,084
application

314
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:09,173
maybe the day is hidden and sat on it
and so Xcode is also going to hide in

315
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:11,079
the next to you why

316
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:14,107
but Xcode knows about it could show it
to you so

317
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,012
I use can simply turn of this option

318
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:22,103
an external show all of your viewers
even the ones they're hidden finally

319
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:23,084
there's the

320
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:27,109
bass string comparison there which will
do an exact match at that list in the I

321
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:32,009
navigator to help you drill down T
exactly the item you're looking for

322
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,100
now let's turn our attention over to the
right hand side

323
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,012
at the Xcode window this is the
inspector area

324
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:42,015
and you might be familiar with this if
you've ever used interface because these

325
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:42,110
are very similar

326
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,002
we have a Object Inspector and there's a
site inspector as well

327
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:51,014
here we see the Object Inspector for you
I am HBO

328
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:54,075
and not only that this is the specific
you I am at you

329
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:57,152
because we're selecting we're clicking
on 1/8

330
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:01,099
in our application so we actually have
the address for that object as well

331
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:05,101
which is resident in memory on your Mac
or on your I was device

332
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:10,068
we have thumbnail and all the other
interesting actually to that

333
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:14,070
about that view listed in this inspector

334
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:17,051
finally we have a site inspector this is
gonna show you the size and position

335
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:21,035
as you might expect it's also going to
show a list

336
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:25,063
I V auto layout constraints that are
affecting that view

337
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:29,071
with two exceptions down at the bottom
ec2 constraints which are deemphasized

338
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:33,128
these are not affecting the layout have
you currently but they're still attached

339
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:34,124
to the view

340
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:38,105
and I still have meaning in this case we
have felt that with

341
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:43,073
I have too high 320 and in the print the
CDC that's content size that's because

342
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:44,107
the system at it this

343
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:49,079
implicitly to this view to represent the
content size

344
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,170
to de-emphasize cuz up above buried
ended with two explicit constraints

345
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:57,045
they were added in Interface Builder and
is also have a with the 320 in this case

346
00:22:58,008 --> 00:22:58,065
but they

347
00:22:58,065 --> 00:23:01,120
might not always match so this is a
great place to check

348
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:05,005
if you're think you're having constraint
issues as we're gonna see

349
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:09,083
and a demo which I'd like to show you
right now

350
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:13,127
alright here we have the application
that humming started with

351
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:17,103
and if you have superego eyes for maybe
not you'll notice that

352
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:21,097
there's a pretty bag visual back down
here I wonder if the beauty fucking

353
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:24,190
in Xcode can help us find that

354
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:28,015
something to switch over to Xcode find
this

355
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:32,180
debug you hire key button and simply
pressing

356
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,029
what's happening now is Xcode going
through all the news in

357
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:41,001
the application and pulling them back
into the Xcode window

358
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:44,012
now we see user interface right here

359
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:47,073
and already you're getting at better
look at what might be

360
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:50,104
issue and its application you see some
other views summit

361
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:54,030
images in this you I collection view are
outside

362
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:57,017
the view where they're supposed to be
contained

363
00:23:57,044 --> 00:24:01,095
that's a that's a pretty interesting
fact to help diagnose the problem but

364
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:08,095
it doesn't help us solve the problem
sorin have to dig deeper

365
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:12,021
to explode the view hierarchy I've your
application all you need to do is simply

366
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:13,060
click

367
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:16,008
and drag anywhere in the congress

368
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:19,078
this allows us to see the the
parent-child relationship between

369
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:21,113
somebody's views

370
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:26,076
I have open on the right hand side the
assistant editor which is an automatic

371
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:26,163
mode

372
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:30,137
this allows extra to track the

373
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:34,095
file that I click over here in their
view to bugger

374
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:37,124
with a source code file that matches
with it

375
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:42,113
so if I click here I get the source code
file for

376
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:46,016
you energy I manage

377
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:50,116
traverse backwards update higher pitched
tell you get to the custom self it

378
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:54,019
has been written for this class the pair
to the issue I am to you

379
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:57,095
is the UI view and this is the content
view that sell

380
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:01,099
and the one behind that is the run
details collection Buechel

381
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,102
which is custom code in my application

382
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,054
mother going to open up the inspector
here

383
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:12,066
and check out some other positions I
these views as it gets

384
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:15,073
it looks like is probably a position
back here the traversing

385
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:19,044
back up the stack starting with one of
these

386
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:22,052
user id has a missing image I am going
to click here

387
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:26,042
and see the position is 160 45

388
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,085
its child is 4545

389
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:34,092
because the position is relative to its
parent

390
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:37,184
but where is this final view I'm gonna
go over to the navigator

391
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:41,141
and find love you have selected is this
your way you live you

392
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,085
and I can simply find where child is I
don't know where it is in

393
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,103
special space but I know where it is and
real

394
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:53,009
hierarchy of the view so if I click here
I see that the position

395
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,102
is a 160 45 and remember that's based on
the parent

396
00:25:57,002 --> 00:26:00,073
so what I'm actually looking at is this
view over here I thought there was a

397
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:00,082
working one

398
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:04,091
but view has been shifted of a

399
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:08,154
cell and its that's the reason it's
missing

400
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:12,110
so let's go back up to the the cell

401
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:17,030
class and take a look at the
implementation class

402
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,058
I mean idk man click on the class name
here to dive into the implementation

403
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:24,060
and here you see a red a fairly simple
implementation

404
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:28,131
for cell view all it does is it
overrides the unit with frame

405
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:32,036
it creates a new UI ImageView and then
add that

406
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:36,052
as the cut isometric view of the content
the right down here

407
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:40,105
are thinking about p information we
found earlier

408
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:44,103
we know there's a position issue and I
can see that were passing the frame

409
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,058
wrecked

410
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:48,095
befell to this subview

411
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:52,095
that's not what I want I want this the
sub you to have the same bounce as the

412
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:52,131
cell

413
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:58,123
so instead a friend req I'm gonna tape
self that bounce

414
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:04,060
the should be enough to fix our problems
I'm gonna build and run

415
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:08,081
switch over to the simulator

416
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:13,123
and Jack back into you are friend
details view

417
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:17,038
sure enough we have the out fully
functioning

418
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,050
you I collection do with dollar images
tightly spaced

419
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,008
as expected now that bugs fixed

420
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,041
I do see another issue see this I

421
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:30,112
this label up here San Fran is sketchy
keen a camper San Francisco but this is

422
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:31,091
a serious

423
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:35,149
running app this is an app for those of
us that go every morning and we don't

424
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:36,128
call

425
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:40,030
this fair city San Fran is a San
Francisco

426
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:44,004
isolates let's go back to bed have if
you go back and see if we can understand

427
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:51,004
what might be going on there

428
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:56,149
I mean it take a moment to admire the
fully functioning

429
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:00,142
you a collection view looks great I mean
it then turn back to you

430
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:05,044
two-dimensional know this button down
here allows us to reset the View Rd

431
00:28:05,044 --> 00:28:09,048
and I'm going to cook on this label

432
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:12,076
alright I know that I'm using auto
layout and miss

433
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:15,132
application so let's go ahead and see if
there's anything having to do with

434
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:16,126
constraints

435
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:20,028
there might be an issue down here is the

436
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:24,067
fasho constraints find this shows all
the constraints

437
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:28,099
and it also dims out the views that are
not currently related to those

438
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:31,174
to that new or its constraints this
allows us to really focus in on the work

439
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:35,100
at hand

440
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,179
when I zoom in

441
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,650
it's plain to see that there are two
constraints attached to this label

442
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:47,088
and if I look over here I see the
witness 95

443
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:50,105
there's any explicit constrain have 95

444
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:54,014
down at the bottom the contents I've is
a hundred and 9.5

445
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:57,181
so clearly somebody added a complex was
a constraint and Interface Builder

446
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:01,109
and that clipping me implicit size

447
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:05,054
a that label so I'm just gonna switch
over to

448
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:08,063
my storyboard find that label and

449
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:12,100
delete that explicit constrain

450
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,179
if I had the time to show you guys I
would had a constraint-based

451
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,950
properly limited that label 13 go beyond
the bounds on the screen but

452
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:23,116
I'm sure you can find in Interface
Builder section for example

453
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:27,059
this afternoon at 3:15 that will at

454
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,154
go into more detail about out allow
constraints

455
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:36,070
and I we have the full string that label

456
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,099
so we've seen it the view to biker is a
fantastic way

457
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:44,109
to both look take a look at your your
application and I invite you to do just

458
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:45,074
that

459
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,079
go back today just after the session

460
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,101
open up your computers just try hitting
the view bigger bang on your application

461
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:53,099
I think you'll find it eliminating

462
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,161
and the integration with Xcode is
fantastic

463
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,083
now I'd like to turn it over to carry
was gonna teach you a little bit more

464
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,172
about quick look

465
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,080
previews

466
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:11,037
think it right my name is carrying and
how is everyone enjoying the conference

467
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:15,076
so far

468
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:18,077
great I know that we are very excited to
be here as well

469
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:23,080
to show some great new debugging
features in Xcode set

470
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:26,032
but first let's take a step back

471
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:30,019
last year Xcode 5 debut with

472
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:35,025
is getting feature whereby as you are
running and debugging your application

473
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:38,027
you can get a live quick look preview

474
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:41,096
above your data simply by clicking on

475
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:44,555
the quick look icon in the debug bar

476
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,010
you can get those pop over that will
show you a preview you could even

477
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:52,044
simply by hovering over the source a
variable

478
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:56,283
in the source editor get a quickly
preview right from there

479
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:59,970
just by clicking on the quickly icon in

480
00:30:59,097 --> 00:31:02,106
the paper that appears now

481
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:06,014
but X good five debuted with the fault
support for

482
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:09,095
a number of important and common object
types

483
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:12,101
like images and busy it has

484
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:16,097
and even things like map locations

485
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:19,120
well we've got a lot of great feedback
from this feature and I know that it's

486
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:20,044
been

487
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:23,147
very useful to number developers
including myself

488
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:27,138
so to build on the success index had sex

489
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:32,111
there is support for to new object types

490
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:36,015
the first is views

491
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:39,086
so wetherbee you i've you are in an
issue

492
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:42,160
you can get a quick look preview %uh
that

493
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:47,062
simply by clicking in the variables you
and clicking on the

494
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:51,020
quickly icon or my favorite is just hit
the spacebar

495
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:54,138
and it'll bring up a nice preview and
considering how

496
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,061
common views are in most applications I
think this will be a very powerful

497
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:01,074
feature

498
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:04,133
now this second object-type that was at

499
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:09,040
is well I honestly don't know

500
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:12,029
that's because it's your own custom
class

501
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:15,123
so now for the first time if you have a
class

502
00:32:16,023 --> 00:32:19,101
that does some custom drying and perhaps
returns

503
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:25,023
a I'm an image or a busy a path or
something like that

504
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:28,101
you can now get a preview that as well

505
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:32,420
before now there wasn't great support
for that

506
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:36,380
so if you were to try and get a preview
you would get this

507
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,587
default view which had some pertinent
information like the name and the

508
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:41,540
address and the type

509
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:44,057
but no preview so

510
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:48,066
I would like to show you how to fix that

511
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:52,125
there's a simple method that you can
implement in your classes implementation

512
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:57,076
and it's called debug quick look object

513
00:32:57,076 --> 00:33:01,111
now in this class you can either call
your drying code or implemented in there

514
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:06,082
but the important point is from this
method you return something that Xcode

515
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:10,159
knows how to show so wanted the default
supported types

516
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:15,091
should be returned from this method and
then you'll be good to go

517
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:19,138
and I would like to show you that now

518
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:23,116
so here we have the jogger application
that we've been seeing in previous

519
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:27,101
jammers and I'm gonna click the routes
button

520
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:32,032
and we'll see on things around from this
morning

521
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:35,035
if thats indeed the case

522
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:38,066
and okay so this class has a

523
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:42,090
and object class called route half
overlay

524
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:45,051
which accesses the run data to

525
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:50,631
generate this busy a path that then gets
overlaid onto the map

526
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,000
so let's look at that a little further
I'm gonna click on the map

527
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,022
and I'm gonna hate this a well scrolls
really fast

528
00:33:59,022 --> 00:34:02,050
gonna hit this breakpoint and the same
trying to debug

529
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:06,434
some issue here now down in the
variables view we can see we've got a

530
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,890
number of local variables like this
point

531
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:12,180
and if I click on the quick look icon I
can see

532
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:16,587
a preview of the point this is our route
path overlay

533
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:21,406
and if I click on not I'm gonna hit the
spacebar and what it just comes up with

534
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:26,500
is just some generic information but we
can do better than that

535
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:29,005
some gonna stop here

536
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:33,012
gonna go to our route path overlay

537
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:38,096
and I've got the method that I was
talking about debug quick look object

538
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:42,019
it's a sort of a long title but

539
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:45,053
try and remember okay and if I i'm
comment that

540
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:48,342
and what this method does it's not
really important because it's going to

541
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:49,930
be different for

542
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:53,042
every custom class but what it does is
it it accesses

543
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,200
each of the 360 for some odd points

544
00:34:58,002 --> 00:35:01,017
a map location the for that Ron

545
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:04,274
and then generates about as a power

546
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:07,800
skills in a little bit and then returns
from at

547
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:10,021
does a path because Xcode 6 knows how to

548
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:14,162
render or quickly preview a busy a power

549
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:18,281
so the now that we've implemented either
an able to

550
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:25,839
I'm gonna run and bike again

551
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:32,065
go to our routes click on the map

552
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:36,073
and if all goes well we should see and
ice

553
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:39,118
detailed preview a each of those point
today to from

554
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:46,157
the start until the ambulance picked up
on me when he collapsed

555
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:49,390
I

556
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,076
attack so when everything today

557
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:56,172
we've she we've seen humming show us how
we can vary easily and more effectively

558
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,106
debug Hughes and blocks

559
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:05,072
with the new cute a bug in future and
then trace showed us how

560
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:08,153
we can more a effectively or easily
explore

561
00:36:09,053 --> 00:36:12,140
our applications view hierarchy I've
used this

562
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,006
very effectively myself I several times

563
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:19,225
been very helpful and then I showed you
how to add

564
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:24,100
quick look previews for your own custom
classes

565
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:27,056
on and remember you can also now preview

566
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:30,102
any view so for more information you can
contact

567
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:36,002
are great developer tools evangelist a
bill on I also got a link here to the

568
00:36:36,002 --> 00:36:37,051
documentation for

569
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:41,400
quick look previews which documentation
will show you

570
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:45,550
will a full list of exactly all the
default supported types

571
00:36:45,055 --> 00:36:48,090
in Xcode sex and then

572
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:51,085
don't forget the developer forms

573
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:55,071
there's a lot of great debugging
sessions this week so be sure to check

574
00:36:56,016 --> 00:36:58,073
them out

575
00:36:58,073 --> 00:36:58,122
thank you very much
