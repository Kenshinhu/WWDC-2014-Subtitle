1
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:15,058
Hyatt hello and welcome to the advanced
graphics animations

2
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:15,857
why what's up

3
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,393
ok I'm actual up next with that he will
take over in the middle of the talk

4
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,602
and was to less talky going to cover the
following topics:

5
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,400
the first part will be talking about the
quantitation pipeline and how it

6
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,140
interacts with the application

7
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:32,103
after this I'm introduce a few rendering
concept that are required to understand

8
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,035
our new two classes you I blow effect
and you haven't the effect

9
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:40,096
and after this Michael takeover and
walking through existing profiling tools

10
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:45,121
and demonstrate a few case studies 228 a
framework to be looking at and at a

11
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,114
distance talk

12
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:51,047
from in the fourth but a top you looking
at coordination and told in taxes OpenGL

13
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:54,776
on some hardware was metal with the
graphics software and then

14
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,256
in the second half of my part ever talk
about you I blow effect on your lap and

15
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,280
the fact that a part of you like it

16
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:03,807
so let's get started with the
coordination pipeline

17
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,111
so it all starts in the application

18
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,615
the application with a few high keep
either indirectly with you like it or

19
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:11,993
directly was cool animation

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,700
wanting was not a thing now is that the
application process

21
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:19,073
is actually not doing the actual
rendering work for coordination instep

22
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:20,074
this

23
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:23,993
if you are a key is committed to Reynoso
up which is a separate process

24
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,200
and israel also has a server-side
version of coordination that receives

25
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:28,781
this your lucky

26
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,530
if your keys then rendered visco
animation

27
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:36,067
miss orange elemental a obvious to you
few accelerated

28
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:39,826
and then one secure key is being
rendered we can finally displayed to the

29
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,433
user

30
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,853
so do things interesting part is now
haha doesn't look like time by

31
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,160
submitting the application so therefore
I would like to introduce the flow

32
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:48,810
Ingrid

33
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,110
the vertical lines represent a vertical
blanking interrupts

34
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:55,068
and Cynthia rendering at sixty have are
you I the distance between doors were

35
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:55,135
declines

36
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:59,040
16.67 milliseconds so

37
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,314
the full thing that happens in the
application be receive an event

38
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,350
probably because the touch and therefore
the usual case

39
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:09,724
but anything to him in this case is that
the 12 update a few hockey

40
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,510
and this happens in the face that we
call the contraction faces in

41
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,052
is no application at the end of the
faith

42
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:20,114
if you are accused and and called and
sent Reynoso

43
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:24,040
the full thing that are in the summer
and the house is difficult to secure a

44
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:24,049
key

45
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:27,171
the end the summer then have to wait for
the next piece Inc

46
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:32,072
in order to made for bus that we get
back from a state you can actually went

47
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:32,117
to

48
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:36,073
and then it finally stopped issuing talk
of

49
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:41,082
to for the Jeep you with OpenGL metal
again then want this is completed

50
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:45,145
hopefully teach PDP resources not
available he can finally start rendering

51
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:50,046
and soldier accused of doing is
rendering work hopefully this rendering

52
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:50,060
book

53
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,028
finishes before the next we think
because then we can

54
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:57,032
swap in the frame buffer and showed if
you are key to the user

55
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:00,166
as you can see this very steps spent
over moves for frames in this case it's

56
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:01,150
three frames

57
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:05,099
and let's say we would now lost continue
with the next 10 leavin to commit

58
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:06,097
transaction

59
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:08,192
after-hours played that we would only be
able to her and that's when he heard not

60
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:09,178
at 60 Hertz

61
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:13,091
so therefore what we're doing is BR
overlaying

62
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:16,157
the stages so in parallel with the drugs
that you can see here people

63
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:22,058
do the next 10-20 vent and the event
commit transaction and so we end up with

64
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:26,107
following step diagram in next few
flights I would like to

65
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,049
focus on commit transaction stage
because that's what effect application

66
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:30,146
developers the most

67
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:34,079
so let's take a look at commit
transaction

68
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,080
commit transaction itself consists of
all fails the first phase this delay of

69
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:38,056
faith

70
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:43,084
does that he set up the fuse then the
next phase is to display faced as they

71
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:43,169
draw to fuse

72
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,123
the sub faces steep repair commit face
heavy

73
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,040
to some additional 20 mission work and
the last phase

74
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:54,043
is maybe actually pick it up the Laos
and seventh-rounder so

75
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,120
in the committee let's look in detail at
those four phases

76
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:04,003
first then they'll face and layout faced
the layouts a fuse alright I invoked

77
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:08,522
does the few creation happens does the
BF left with short he was that's a few

78
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,970
and is very popular content and to some
lightweight database lookup something

79
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,122
like this because we don't want to stall
here too long

80
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:18,068
like this could be for example localized
strings because we need him at this

81
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:19,347
point in order to put

82
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,550
to a labor layout because of this the
faith

83
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:28,071
usually Cebu bond oil about the second
phase of the display 5

84
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,078
disadvantage or contents the store
activity overridden audio stream drawing

85
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,063
one thing what both noting here is that
this

86
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:39,112
faith is actually Cebu on a rebound
because the rendering is so for us to

87
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:40,104
rise to use your

88
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:44,603
cool graphics was rendering and Soviet
leaders rendering with

89
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,310
CG context so the point is here that we
want to minimize the work that we do

90
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:52,360
with call graphics to avoid a lot
performance in the stage

91
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,690
next faithful to prepare faced this is
the image decoding image conversion

92
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:57,128
happens

93
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:02,041
image tickling should be straightforward
the 75th and images and if you are a key

94
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:02,137
and

95
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:06,106
this trip XO PNG's I getting the call it
at this point

96
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,058
image conversion it's not quite so
straightforward what happens here is

97
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:13,058
that we might have images that I in a
format that has cheated on

98
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:16,107
that is not supported by the GP you and
definitely need to convert

99
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:20,074
his images a good example is could be
indexed bitmaps leave want to avoid

100
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:23,131
certain image formats

101
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,120
in the last faced the cliff face the
package up the layers and send them to

102
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,041
run the server

103
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,358
this process is because if you have to
trade with really a tree and is

104
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,570
expensive the latter is complex or do
that's why we want to keep the left rear

105
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:36,376
strut as possible

106
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:43,310
to make sure that that it's part of the
faces is efficient as can be

107
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:46,057
so let's take a look how this works
animation animations themself

108
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:49,123
three-stage process I'm two of those
happen in fact application

109
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:54,049
at the last eight happens on the in the
summer the first they just let me Chris

110
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:57,060
where we create animation update of your
key this happens usually was the

111
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,008
animators duration:

112
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:01,097
animations Meffert then the second stage
is every

113
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,074
prepared committee animation this is
where earlier a few

114
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:08,085
been called and direct and that promise
of familiar

115
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:12,144
and it is because is out for fails we
are just looking at

116
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:15,132
the only difference here is that with
the committee don't just committed if

117
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:16,661
you are a key

118
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,970
recommit as well D animation and it's a
reason because we would like to hand off

119
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:23,190
the animation booked Reynoso so that we
can

120
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,010
continue to update your animations
result using inter-process communication

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,071
to talk back to the application of
awesome backed with the application

122
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:35,122
so look for proficiency reasons

123
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:39,971
saw let's take a look at a few rendering
conflate the required to have

124
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:45,270
understand and you visual effects that
yet providing you with what I was eight

125
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:48,033
for his part of a talker I'm covering
three areas first time it's pandering to

126
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,059
this whole or GP was work

127
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:53,108
then I'm going to introduce the concept
of render passes because on the effect

128
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:56,097
for use with for in the path of

129
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,040
and then I'm doing a fourth example by
showing you home asking works is when a

130
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,075
passive

131
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,076
so let's take a look at times rendering
with famous rendering the screen is

132
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,122
split into title and I and pixels

133
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:11,025
have put your screen shot together and
all it to the grits bacon he actually

134
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:12,011
bought it has

135
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,523
thanks would be like the time for the
children so that it fits into

136
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,470
into the SLC cash and the ID is here
that the geometry split 2-2 tie back its

137
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:27,306
and I would like to demonstrate this a
by using the phone taken as an example

138
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,040
as you can see the full I can spend much
but I'll and

139
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:34,085
before i cant others when it is he a
layup and the CLA NCAA israel's

140
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:37,102
two triangles and if you look at the two
triangles

141
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:42,053
they're still spending multiple
triangles through to the tiles

142
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:44,151
and thought if you were doing now it
will not stop splitting up those trying

143
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:45,057
of

144
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:50,570
many committed but I'll so that each
type can be rented individually

145
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,766
the idea fear the beard do with process
novel who geometry so at some point we

146
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,720
have to geometry for each to collect
that and then we can make decisions

147
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:00,081
on what pictures are visible and then
decide but pick such a two-run three-run

148
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:01,138
each pixel shader

149
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,050
when he wants public's home

150
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:08,024
obviously if you do banning this doesn't
quite work that we still have to you

151
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,093
problem overdrawn

152
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:15,135
so let's take a look at what type up
when Rick passes I'll

153
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:19,664
so let a few applications has built a
few her keeps coordination

154
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,210
it's committed to render so and comic
when mission you call it it

155
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:27,078
and now it needs to end it and it will
use OpenGL metal

156
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:30,687
and it's like I'm just saying metal for
simplicity Tremlett

157
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,392
and it will generate with hope your
comment but that is then submitted to GP

158
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:35,480
you

159
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,190
at the Jeep Europe received this command
before and stop doing at work

160
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,278
the first thing that you do is what text
processing those that about action

161
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:44,487
around

162
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:47,831
and ideas here that would transform all
about this isn't a screen space at this

163
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,050
stage

164
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:52,054
so that we can do tend to the second
stage with his bitches get retailing

165
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:55,058
actually tell the geometry fought
advocates

166
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:58,157
and this part of the state Scott but I
left side you will be able to find

167
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:02,112
in the instruments in the open OpenGL ES
driver instrument

168
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:06,013
and %uh palo utilization

169
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:09,075
the output of the state's is written and
something called the parents about from

170
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:12,081
and the next stage is not starting
millions that

171
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,085
the leave made no answer or geometry is
processed and sits in the family to

172
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,025
buffer

173
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:19,083
or into the pan with a purpose for
because the problem is if the problem is

174
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,147
full we have to flush it

175
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,086
and it's actually performance it on
because they meet with automatic

176
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:24,160
processing

177
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:28,100
and gets front load the pics a shift
work

178
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:34,083
and except to say that status as a set
up extra stage

179
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,114
the stage is actually call to render a
stage and you can find again in the

180
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,029
instruments or your structural

181
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,127
a and that the name ring writers Asian
and the output of the stage is written

182
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:44,120
to something called

183
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,027
you in the buffer K

184
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:52,072
South take a look at a practical example
by looking at masking

185
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:55,076
let's assume of your keys way to go the
command buffer is

186
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:58,135
sitting miss the few and you can stop
processing

187
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,060
for the full thing happens in the fourth
pastors that be rendered the

188
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:06,020
delay I'm off to a texture in this case
that this camera icon

189
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:09,133
them in the second pass P render the
their content with extra

190
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:13,602
and in this case with this kinda blew
material

191
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:17,700
and then in the last part that he called
it compositing possibly apply to master

192
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,206
the content texture

193
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,250
and composite to rate the result a
screen and up is dis light blue camera

194
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,101
icon

195
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:29,002
saw let's take a look at you I'd love a
factor for those that don't know

196
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,048
you I blow effect can be used with you
as a visual effect few and

197
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:37,105
does not public API since I was 8 it
basically allows you to use the broth

198
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:42,007
that introduces I was having and be
providing you with three different law

199
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,083
stuff that I want to demonstrate your

200
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,182
to piss regular I O S wallpaper and
apply to three blocks that that you have

201
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:47,141
to it

202
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,470
extra light light and dark a

203
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,895
so let's take a look how does look
performance wife

204
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,930
I'm using Google Docs time as an example
for rendering process the doc style

205
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:01,096
actually using the law was the model for
an apostle and

206
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:05,052
the I think your mind number in the past
depends on how to be difficult to other

207
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:05,136
nations

208
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:09,129
for certain pop pop up

209
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,127
for the fourth past year end of the
content that was going to be blood

210
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:18,216
then in the second part of be captured a
confident on scale it

211
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,497
the downscale depends on the hardware so
in disc fly to cap it at a certain size

212
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,680
with the readable

213
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:27,119
then in like the past few play the
actual blog arisen which

214
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,101
separated so we do for the horizontal
and vertical blom

215
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:35,073
there's actually a con brio optimization
because do with anything a pass but

216
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:36,104
let's assume our

217
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:40,030
blower car would be eleven by 11 this
would mean we would need to read how

218
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,162
twenty-one samples per pixel

219
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,770
by separating it to be or need to read
11 samples per pixel

220
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:49,586
cage bus so after the 4th path we have
to love

221
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,370
horizontally and vertically blot small
tiny area

222
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:56,110
and so what's left in the last part is
that need to upscale display or intended

223
00:11:57,001 --> 00:12:00,052
in this case we end up them to sell a
doctor

224
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:05,097
so that looks fine but let's take a look
how this looks like performance wise

225
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:08,656
so what it as a test I critical full
screen layout and

226
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,800
applied to your bluff effect to it and
measure the performance and a staggering

227
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,047
can see three roles

228
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,200
the first rule group effort I'll
activity second-rower interactivity

229
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:22,073
and to the last row I put in the black
interrupt you can actually see you

230
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:26,114
what friend boundaries are and again be
running at 60 votes are you I

231
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:31,893
so time you have as 16.67 seconds

232
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,480
so let's focus on on a single frame

233
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:39,157
as you can see a first look here the
first Tyler path is happening before the

234
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,670
first when their paths and that's
because

235
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:44,092
the Thailand the process all geometries
with emphasize what we just saw on a

236
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:46,123
previous life

237
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:50,062
so let's go quickly what passes against
the footpath if the

238
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,307
content past the time for this penance
really depends really on if you are a

239
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,140
key

240
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:58,403
in this case it's just the simple image
so it might take longer in use in

241
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,160
real-world

242
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:03,064
you I'm then in the second panel 3
downscale

243
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:06,118
and capture the content it's actually
fairly fast

244
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,020
at his pre-match consul cost then

245
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:13,043
the surpasses yours on two brothers
again constant calls for two pretty fast

246
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:13,122
because the

247
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:17,641
only played on a very small area and
then in the fourth piles

248
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,170
me to refer to comply or again very fast
and

249
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:25,186
we end up with a blow to region and then
in the last past the upscale

250
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:28,364
and tint people are

251
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,660
the one thing you will notice now others
gaps between those passes left my time

252
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,435
here in Orange

253
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,660
and those cats I actually did you idle
time and to happen because we do here

254
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,088
rent a context switch

255
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:40,126
in on this John a jeep you and this can
actually quite

256
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:43,855
at up quite quickly because the time
spent here and at other times per

257
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,600
possible to your point want to

258
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:48,078
your point to a few seconds so in this
case was four passes we have bought at a

259
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:52,033
time of 0.4 to 0.8 milliseconds

260
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:57,662
which is a good thing if you can track
of our 16.67 milliseconds

261
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,170
let's take a look out a book performs on
the various devices from

262
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:04,026
so again this is the full screen blow to
use that I used before and

263
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:08,216
measured as well on iPad 3 such
innovation

264
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,040
and as you can see the iPod Touch
generation performs much worse than the

265
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:12,793
iPad app

266
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,470
in the interest in the in the case of
text the lead lawyer the timing

267
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:20,036
is 18 point 15 in the second for the
country and that 60% of the type of

268
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,980
wrong about him

269
00:14:21,098 --> 00:14:24,135
and polite and actually around fourteen
point five milliseconds

270
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:28,714
which leads us about 20 seconds for you
i've which is not really enough for

271
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,000
entering any compelling you I'm

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,025
so the decision be made on I was seven
already was that we would is able to

273
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,067
bring on certain devices

274
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,067
and the iPod Touch generation is one of
those devices and with this

275
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:41,082
the former on the iPad situation changes
to this

276
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:44,137
you basically just apply it in play on
top so that we can actually do believe

277
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,038
he is the same as

278
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:49,116
with possibly effect

279
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:55,375
saw and to either it on what devices we
don't want to be only 22 tinting

280
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,440
on the iPad 2 and iPad such generational
be just the private in Danby skip the

281
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:00,313
blow steps

282
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:04,200
on iPad 4th generation iPod air iPad
Mini iPad Mini

283
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:10,511
was richard is playing or iPhones and
iPod Touch do both the Bryant attending

284
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,734
soul in summary for the you I visual
effects few with you I play fact

285
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,040
you I blow effect it would have to ask
impasses depending on the style

286
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,390
when he died two weeks redrawn so it's
actually fine if you have

287
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,178
a large blur area and you don't have
that content behind it because they only

288
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,200
apply to blow one's

289
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:30,881
effective very costly so the United can
be easily Jeep you belong to

290
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,110
so therefore you should keep the balance
of the few a small as possible

291
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:40,073
and therefore as well he should make
sure to put it for defect

292
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,073
saw next let's take a look at you I
violence effect

293
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,168
you have aren t affect the city is in
effect issues on top of the blender from

294
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:49,537
interviews for content which can make
sure that content thanks out and doesn't

295
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,380
go unnoticed the broth

296
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:55,069
so let's take a look how does look like
at this hour three blocks that again

297
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,091
and let's assume the bonds to render the
camera icon from

298
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,092
I'm asking example from before on top

299
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:04,148
and this could look like this if you
don't use any balance effect and as you

300
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,135
can see was the light style

301
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:10,044
there might be too large booty issues
because the great stuff leading

302
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:13,693
out so what decided to us that we edit
some

303
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,160
if I'm into effect and the primacy
effect and at the pump through and then

304
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:20,037
you end up with nice private look

305
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:23,069
saw let's take a look how does affect
performance

306
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:26,111
so back to or in the past agro

307
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:31,048
the first five passes are in this case
for the doctor or the broadcast

308
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:34,143
and then in a six pack of beer another
their content to a texture

309
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:38,642
and then in the final compositing pass
we take the

310
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,000
their content and apply filter and
composited on top of the block

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,032
don't be fooled here from the for the
cause actually quite expensive and I

312
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:50,057
wanna shoulders and next couple of
flights

313
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:53,376
so this is our order and I come from
before the South the the steps what a

314
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,810
blow and lets at on now the steps for
the vibrancy effect

315
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:01,480
so in perfect a meeting in here from
content that is ok mr. Aiken

316
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,221
and damn obviously the cost for this
past depends on what you're entering

317
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:06,380
their

318
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,844
what very few very few have key looks
like

319
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,432
and then last past the apply the filter
and as you can see the for the cause

320
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,322
actually very expand the fifth

321
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,130
actually the most expensive path we have
here

322
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:21,712
one thing to keep in mind here is that I
apply to balance the effect of which can

323
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,970
carry on

324
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:25,816
the recommendation is to not apply to
pharmacy effect with with Marion stat to

325
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:32,701
only apply it to us more content areas
to avoid to tissues performance penalty

326
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:37,030
about time for life a the did you have
no spam or caps because you have more in

327
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:39,032
a pass a Saudi g2 I'll a time

328
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:44,098
has increased as well if not six caps
and this can add up to 0.6 pool 21.2 mi

329
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:44,151
seconds

330
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:48,350
by the time about you

331
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:54,040
saw let's take a look how does look on
my putts a generation and iPad a.m.

332
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:57,078
does the base cost from before 4.59 many
seconds for the iPod Touch I actually

333
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:58,147
don't blow

334
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:02,140
and a different times for the iPad and
depending on the blast I'll

335
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:07,041
solitaire on and what we can see is for
the fourth been effective therapy is

336
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:10,176
spending on iPad saturation about 27 to
26 many seconds just

337
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:15,104
for applying the vibrancy effect on the
iPod

338
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:19,011
air we spend about 17.48 me second
flexalite style and

339
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:23,090
around 40 milliseconds for light and oxo
you don't have a lot of time left on a

340
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,048
gp2 any other rendering

341
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,108
I mean 22nd from the best case here
sought to emphasize again we should

342
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,046
really restrictive RNC effect on a small
area to avoid is huge

343
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:35,113
keep your head so in summary

344
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:39,027
the UI vibrancy effect at to a screen
pass earth

345
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,436
you i havent effect use expensive
company is an expensive compositing for

346
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:43,742
the full content

347
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,334
therefore you should only use the
vibrancy effect on the small regions

348
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,540
arm again like the blonde only to return
to read wrong

349
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:54,183
and you I'm into effect is very costly
on all devices

350
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:58,090
so with less was the Blue Earth you I
can the BG view bound

351
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:01,060
keep the bounds of the fuse as small as
possible I make sure to

352
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,011
budget for defects so

353
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:06,134
next I would like to give a couple of
optimization techniques take the

354
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,038
techniques on the way I

355
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,119
ones with relation authorization can be
used the composite which once was the

356
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,057
Jeep you

357
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:16,121
this can be neighbors they should trust
their eyes property on a clar and

358
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:20,120
a few things to keep in mind when doing
this first

359
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:24,010
extra of composite a creative MB update
the content foolish only used it for

360
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,057
static content

361
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:28,916
secondly you should I use it because the
cache size for us relations limited to

362
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,740
25.5 times of the screen size

363
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:34,119
so if you stop setting dress dress
property of on last part of your

364
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:38,058
few hockey you might lower the cash over
and over and end up as a lot of

365
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:38,104
additional

366
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:42,004
ski passes last

367
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:45,013
up arrest was impressed with images I
because from the cash

368
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:49,026
if they are you someone how many seconds
so you wanna make sure that use this

369
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,185
only for image that conversely you stand
up for

370
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,420
in Tripoli's them just because then you
working through every time a mosque

371
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,580
impasse

372
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:59,109
so typically use cases are to avoid
ridge or redrawing expensive

373
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,071
effect was that the content seek redress
rice for example a blow

374
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:06,114
and the other thing is to have what we
doing a complex you are key so we could

375
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:10,028
breast rice for few are key in composite
is on top of a blur

376
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:13,119
wonderbra so the last thing

377
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:18,095
I have here is capacity capacity can be
disabled was the last capacity property

378
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:19,119
I see a layup

379
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:24,388
a capacity but actually in terms of
capacity for Laos not a pixels means

380
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,610
your past the property is not equal on
points year old

381
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,064
and for last long trip the content that
means that China Laos

382
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:34,114
or a background image and but isn't on
the status of your account to be

383
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:35,089
composited

384
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:39,097
before it's being blended and if America
nations was told of its not need

385
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:43,074
be very careful with this was this

386
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:50,074
I would like a plan talk to Mike 42

387
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:56,089
so I am i crossing software engineer on
the island on Steam

388
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:00,134
and the first thing on talk about are
tools so

389
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:04,132
before I get into tools though I do want
to mention prompt investigation might

390
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:08,047
so basically what are the questions
running through my head when

391
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,131
I encounter performance issue want to
start tracking down the source about

392
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:15,062
so first thing I want to know is what is
the frame right

393
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:18,063
you know it's always good to know where
you're starting performance wise so that

394
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:20,161
you can gauge how the changes you make
are affecting performance

395
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:25,068
so our goal is always 60 frames per
second we want to ensure that we have

396
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:28,058
smooth scrolling and I smooth animations

397
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:31,141
to provide a good user experience so our
target should always be 60 frames per

398
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,060
second next up

399
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:38,028
I wanna know are we see peerage if you
down you know obviously the

400
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:41,161
slow realization the better because will
let us had our performance targets

401
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:47,146
and also give us better battery life
netting 10

402
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:51,083
other any unnecessary is there any
unnecessary CP rendering

403
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,160
so basically are we overriding for all
right somewhere where we really

404
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:55,092
shouldn't be

405
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:59,055
you know kind understanding what
rendering and how rendering

406
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:04,090
we want the Jeep you do as much with us
as make sense next thing on a No

407
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:08,048
is do we have too many offspring passes
as actual pointed out previously

408
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:13,070
of green passes basically give the Jeep
you idle time because I have to contact

409
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:13,064
switches

410
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:17,120
so we want to have fewer offspring
passes fewer the better

411
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:22,015
next up I wanna know is there too much
blending in the Y

412
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:25,034
on we obviously want to do less funding
because blending

413
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,044
is more expensive for the Jeep you to do
then rendering

414
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:31,084
as normal a player so responding better

415
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:35,091
necks I want to know is are there any
strange image formats were sizes

416
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:40,061
basically want to avoid on-the-fly
conversion image formats

417
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:44,048
as I 2.0 previously if you are

418
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:47,049
rendering an image that is nice in the
color format is not supported by the

419
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:47,122
Jeep you

420
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:52,096
then it has to be converted by the CPU
and so we want to try and wait anything

421
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:53,112
on the fly like that

422
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:58,058
next up on an order any expensive user a
fax

423
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:01,083
learn vibrancy are awesome but we want
to make sure that we're using them

424
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,110
sparingly in a way

425
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:07,062
that will give us the sprawling
performance that we want and lastly

426
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:10,160
oh noes or anything unexpected in the
View Park on you know

427
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:14,035
if you have a situation we are
constantly adding removing views you

428
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,137
know you could introduce a bike
accidentally that's a

429
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,114
you know insert a nation forgets to
remove them or you know your

430
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:24,075
adding use your parking forgetting to
remove them you wanna make sure that you

431
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:25,169
only have the views that you really need

432
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:30,098
mom you know in your heart key because
you want to avoid excessive CPU use a

433
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:30,186
back forty

434
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:35,137
so now let's get into some other tools
that will give us the answers to these

435
00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:36,102
questions

436
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:40,088
so first up on talk about instruments
and particularly will talk about

437
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:43,100
are the coronation instrument in the
OpenGL ES driver instrument

438
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,094
then I will say a few things about the
simulator that you can do with colored

439
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:47,171
about options

440
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:51,078
and I will briefly talk about a new
feature in Xcode

441
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:57,073
for life you debugging device so first
up

442
00:23:57,073 --> 00:24:00,172
if you want instruments and select the
coronation temple

443
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,166
that will give you a document that
contains

444
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:08,068
a coronation instrument and a time
profile learns from

445
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:11,071
if you select the coronation instrument

446
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:14,108
you can then choose which is the six you
wanna show

447
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:18,027
in this case its only frames per second

448
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:22,055
so will choose that and then when you
take a trace it will show you your frame

449
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:26,057
rate so you can see in the column here
shows you the frames per second for each

450
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:27,069
interval that this

451
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:31,162
trace was running for you see this in
sample intervals likewise

452
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:35,108
wanna see what the CPU's doing are you
can select the time profiler

453
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:41,075
instrument and so you slept and you can
then see an aggregate the call stack

454
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:44,126
what the CPU was doing while you were
taking a trace

455
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,109
so this is where you would look for you
know I am i overriding drive rack too

456
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,094
much spending too much time in a
threatening

457
00:24:50,094 --> 00:24:54,171
thread doing things that I shouldn't be
next up let's talk about some other

458
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:59,073
color debug options that are part of the
coronation instrument so if you select

459
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:00,089
the coronation instrument

460
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:03,152
you can see the color debug options over
here on the right

461
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:08,078
so let's go through what those are first
up

462
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:12,079
we have color-blind a player's and so
this will tent this will 10 players

463
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,127
green better appcake and two players red
have to be planted

464
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:19,125
as we said previously you know layers
that have to be blind it is more work

465
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:20,116
for the Jeep you

466
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:24,047
and so you ideally want to see less red

467
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:27,121
you know and more cream but there are
gonna be cases where you can avoid it

468
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:32,107
on for example in this particular case
we have a white people view

469
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:36,009
with white people who sells and we
noticed that our labels

470
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:40,103
are you know having to be blended here
so if we made our labels in this case

471
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:44,074
opaque then we wouldn't have to worry
about doing the blind

472
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:48,121
on so that would be one opposition we
can make in this particular case

473
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:54,024
next up color hit screens and missus red
this shows you how you're using or

474
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:54,122
abusing

475
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:59,022
on the should Rasta rise property on see
a liar

476
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:02,070
so what this will do is it will it will
tense cash it's green

477
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:06,089
cache misses red so you know as a 2.0
previously keep in mind that your cache

478
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:08,140
size is only two and a half sine

479
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:12,026
times the size of the screen and items

480
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:15,084
are affected from the cash if they're
not used than a hundred milliseconds so

481
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:19,092
you know it's good to use this
particular coloring book option to see

482
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:22,095
how the cow you're utilizing the cash
with

483
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:26,109
you know what you have such a rush to
respond

484
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:30,022
when you first launcher app you're going
to see a lot of washing right because

485
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,098
you obviously have to render it once
before can be cashed

486
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:35,134
but after that you don't wanna see a
whole lotta flashes red because

487
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:39,038
you know as we have previously you know
any thing you're doing is going to incur

488
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:41,080
offering passes you have to render a

489
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:44,017
and then stick it in cash so

490
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:47,121
next item is color copy images on

491
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:51,089
you as we said before if an image is in
a format as in the color format

492
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:54,098
that the chief you can't work directly
with it will have to be converted by the

493
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:55,141
CPU

494
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:59,044
so in this particular example you know
this is a simple

495
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:04,073
far photo browsing arm were just getting
images from an online source more not

496
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,089
really checking her size

497
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:09,123
or their or their color format on its
own if it were case we're getting images

498
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:11,108
that are 16 bits per component

499
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:16,037
and so you can see that they're tutored
sign here that is telling us that these

500
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:19,043
images had to be converted by the CPU
and commit phase

501
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:22,077
before they can actually be rendered so
you know for this

502
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:24,164
particular case we don't wanna do this
on the fly because I will fax growing

503
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:26,069
performance

504
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:29,124
on with so you can beforehand

505
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:34,076
you know convert your images to the size
and color format you're expecting

506
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:37,115
and it's best to do this in you in the
background so you're not eating up time

507
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:42,059
on the main thread while you're trying
to scroll or doing other things

508
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,152
so the next option is color misaligned
images this will tent

509
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:49,129
images yellow that are being scaled
until images purple

510
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:53,036
that are not pixel on you know as it had
previously it's always good to make sure

511
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:55,184
that images are in the color format the
size that you want

512
00:27:56,084 --> 00:27:59,089
because the last thing you want to be
doing is you know doing conversions and

513
00:27:59,089 --> 00:27:59,176
scaling

514
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:03,119
on the fly while you're scrolling so the
same prince will be applied

515
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,056
in a previous life who also apply here
to get rid of the scaling

516
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:11,155
fly so next up is color of green yellow

517
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:16,066
so this will 10 layers yellow based on
the number of green passes

518
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:21,158
that each layer occurs so be more yellow
you see the more of green passes we have

519
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:25,150
if you notice the NAP are and the
toolbar are tinted yellow

520
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:29,012
that's because there are players with
these layers that are

521
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:32,129
actually during the concept behind it so
we expect those but I do find it curious

522
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,035
that the images

523
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:38,052
are having offering passes so we'll take
a look at that later on the presentation

524
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:41,084
and see how to work around this issue

525
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:44,117
so next is collar Open GL fast path blue

526
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:48,080
and so what this will do is this will 10
layers blue that are being planted by

527
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:49,042
the display hardware

528
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:54,059
on this is actually a good thing you
wanna see because if we have content

529
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,118
with being bent blinded by the display
hardware

530
00:28:57,018 --> 00:29:00,027
the Nets less work for the Jeep you have
to do so in this case if you see

531
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,031
something show up in blue

532
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:04,068
that's a good thing on

533
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:07,175
last option is flash up the two regions
and so what this will do is it will

534
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:08,120
flash

535
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:13,014
her to the screen yellow that are being
updated on this particular example is

536
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:14,068
with the clocks out the ship's

537
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:18,071
in I last are you notice that the yellow
regions here

538
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:22,181
are the second-hand ideally you only
want to see

539
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:26,119
part to the screen flashing yellow the
you're actually updating again because

540
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:28,021
it means less work for the

541
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:32,120
GP you must work the CPU so if you turn
this on you don't want to see

542
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:36,011
a lot a flashing yellow unless you
actually are updating

543
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,086
that much of the screen so in summary

544
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:44,101
some other questions that the coronation
instrument will help you get to

545
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:49,030
I will help you figure with from readers
is there any unnecessary CP rendering

546
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:49,055
because

547
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:52,101
it does include the time profiler
instrument

548
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,067
on panel also with the colored by the
options you can see are things like

549
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:58,156
other too many offering passes how much
when things going on

550
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:04,114
and you have any strange image format
your size is that not expecting

551
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:08,033
and so one additional point on color and
options some

552
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:11,036
love the color and options are available
in the eye with simulator so you can see

553
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,120
the example here

554
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:16,041
a few things to point out with this the

555
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,068
colors might be slightly different
because the version CA that's running

556
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,150
inside the simulators actually person at
the aid atlanta with 10 on iowa's

557
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,078
so if you see any discrepancies always
trust what you see on device

558
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:31,038
because that your customers actually
gonna be using home

559
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,073
so this is a good future because you can
have you like for your testing team go

560
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:34,144
off

561
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:39,056
and poke around your app and see if you
have any unexpected offering passes or

562
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:43,073
any conversion or anything that looks
suspicious

563
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:47,077
so next topic on talk about the OpenGL
ES driver in

564
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:51,083
so if you watch instruments and select
the OpenGL ES driver template

565
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:55,098
that will give you a document that
contains the OpenGL ES driver instrument

566
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:59,196
and and and the time profiler instrument
so if you select the OpenGL ES driver

567
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,144
instrument

568
00:31:02,044 --> 00:31:06,059
you can choose from which the CITIC
Pacific's you want to actually collect

569
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,060
when I'm investigating things I tend to
go for

570
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:12,121
advice realization which will show you
how much the Jeep use in use during the

571
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:13,120
truth

572
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,010
i render entirely realization does
correspond to the renderer

573
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,022
entirely phases that axles I talked
about previously

574
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:23,110
and then of course the coronation frames
per second because I want to know what

575
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:27,036
the actual frame rate is that we're
seeing

576
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:30,066
so if you take a trace

577
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:33,100
and then select the coroner the OpenGL
yes driver

578
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,062
instrument you can then look at the
statistics

579
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,094
and see if approved for example in this
case you know we are getting 60 frames

580
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:41,101
per second

581
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,040
and our device utilization is in like
the mid

582
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:48,011
lower 70's so you know depends on what

583
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,043
you are your rendering so you know you
may want to investigate this

584
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:55,149
gold like that all boils down to what
you're actually rendering for this case

585
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,098
and likewise since we have the time
overall arrangement here you can see

586
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:00,149
with the CPU's doing

587
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:05,074
so if you select that you can then again
look at an aggregate cost tax

588
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:08,143
what's going on in the CPU during this
time to this is always useful because

589
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:10,114
you can highlight certain regions

590
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,017
you know if you notice that you're
dropping free in 3 knows a lot of

591
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:14,106
activity you can zoom in and see

592
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:19,084
what the CPU was doing during a
particular time

593
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:22,087
so in summary with the OpenGL ES driver
instrument you know this will give you

594
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:25,038
answers to questions like What is your
frame rate

595
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,040
are you can see what the CPU and CPU
were doing and you can also use the time

596
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:30,039
profiler instrument

597
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:35,094
to see other any unnecessary CPU
rendering going on

598
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:39,103
so next up is a really cool feature that
was added Xcode

599
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:44,052
for live you debugging on device so if
you open your project in Xcode

600
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:48,097
and then run it and then click the
Follow button on the bottom here

601
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:52,100
on what it will actually do is it will
grab the view hierarchy of the device

602
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,074
and you can then go poking around the
view hierarchy in C what exact use are

603
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:56,152
in your

604
00:32:57,052 --> 00:33:00,090
you why so this is always good because
you can expect to see a better if

605
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:01,084
there's anything unexpected there

606
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:05,143
you know maybe something is building up
you have a legal thing animations or

607
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:06,096
something

608
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:09,163
or constraints so this is good to
actually see what the view hierarchy is

609
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:11,068
on your device

610
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:14,114
versus say what you conceptually think
it is when you're writing your co

611
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:18,028
home if you select an individual item
arm

612
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:21,105
or noonan individual view you can look
at the properties for its ok in this

613
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:23,104
case we selected the UI view

614
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:27,043
and you can see details about what
property in image is currently being

615
00:33:27,043 --> 00:33:30,100
rendered by that you

616
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,049
so summary for Xcode you debugging this
will let you poke around in your view

617
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,112
hierarchy see what's actually being
rendered on device

618
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:41,055
you know which is helpful because you
can see if you have any expensive use

619
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:44,104
are you looking at their properties
you've seen with the Browns are what not

620
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:48,029
and it also good to see if you have
anything building up unexpectedly

621
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:51,066
you are key

622
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:54,109
so next up was talk about some case
studies so what I want to do with this

623
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:57,015
is i wanna talk about a couple different
scenarios

624
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:01,071
and measure performance across different
devices and then we'll figure out how we

625
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:03,102
can work around these performance
problems

626
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,047
and keep the same visual appearance but
you know get the performance gain

627
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:12,091
we want so first up was talk about a
fictitious photo application

628
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,139
so this is just a simple application
with the table view were each table view

629
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:16,130
cell has

630
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:21,031
image and a couple lines attacks and
there's also a small shadow

631
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:24,647
behind each image so if we take this to
me

632
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:30,360
measure the performance on an iPhone 5
us using your Julius driver engine

633
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:33,043
you know we can see that we're hitting
50 frames per second so

634
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:36,085
that's good 60 frames per second or
target so awesome

635
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:39,087
ship it not just yet arm

636
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:43,022
we you know actually love all over
customers and we wanna make sure

637
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:46,201
everybody has a good user experience
regardless of what device they run

638
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,460
so let's take a look at some of the
other devices that

639
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:52,094
we support in Iowa City see how to
perform it stacks up

640
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:55,099
so first off let's look at the iPod
Touch

641
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,115
so I'm curious what's growing feels like
iPod Touch

642
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:03,027
so you know again we'll take your iPod
Touch and will use the OpenGL ES driver

643
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:04,030
instrument

644
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:08,080
and you know sure enough we notice our
frame rate is in the mid-thirties

645
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:13,083
which is nowhere near our target so that
would be a lousy scrolling experience

646
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:16,182
and if we look the device utilization we
see that

647
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:20,126
you know this is like mid to high 70's
home

648
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:23,099
this strikes me is really kinda odd
because all we're doing is we're

649
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,107
screwing around a couple

650
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:29,078
image thumbnails and syntax so I don't
really expect this much

651
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:32,155
GPO activity so was sleeping figure out
what's going on here

652
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:36,072
so first in 10 is you know

653
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:39,078
what's in my view our keys or anything
unexpected here so

654
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:43,132
we use the X could be bucking feature we
grab the view hierarchy

655
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:47,090
I don't really see anything surprising
here so we've got unity will you sell

656
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:48,041
with an ImageView

657
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:53,041
into labels nothing on nothing out of
the ordinary here so

658
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:57,129
receiving figure out something else so
if we use the coronation instrument

659
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:01,033
you know remembering that often passes
are expensive what if we have any of

660
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:02,147
being passes are unexpected

661
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:06,064
and sure enough this is the slide in a
reference previously

662
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:09,139
so you know we have of green passes for
the images

663
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:13,112
which again strikes me as curious let's
take a look at the code and see what

664
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:16,025
we're doing how are we setting this up

665
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:19,029
so as I said each each

666
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:22,106
image from now as shadow how
regenerating

667
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:26,077
so in this case we were asking for
animation very shadow for us

668
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:29,088
and we're doing that just by sending
shot a radio show to offset

669
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:32,157
you know and other properties on
basically what we're doing this

670
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,066
coronation have to figure out what the
shapeless shadow looks like

671
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:41,048
I mean when it does this it has to take
of green passes to render the content

672
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:43,122
and then look at the office China love
which is rendered to figure out where

673
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,035
the shadow belongs

674
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:49,077
and then go through all the actual work
doing the the shuttle itself

675
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:52,099
is there a better way you know what we
can do to avoid this and it turns out

676
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,107
there's

677
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:57,093
on if we add the following line to
there's the Shining Path property

678
00:36:57,093 --> 00:37:01,102
arm you know were only scrolling image
from Nelson just basically racks various

679
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:02,086
sizes

680
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,133
we can usually figure out you know what
the shape of the shadow needs to look

681
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,101
like because again they're all just

682
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:12,062
you know various sized rectangles are so
if we take advantage of the shadow power

683
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:15,110
property and at that to our code

684
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:19,029
then coronation doesn't have to eat up
any offspring passes

685
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:22,125
to actually generate the shadows so
let's play let's make this change will

686
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,026
add this line

687
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:27,070
and mystical look with the coronation
instrument to see

688
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:30,093
if this really did get rid of are often
passes in sure enough it did

689
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:35,138
so this is great less often passes means
you know left idle time on the Jeep you

690
00:37:36,038 --> 00:37:39,074
so let's take a tray since you were
strong performance looks like

691
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:43,142
so again looking an iPod Touch will use
the OpenGL ES driver instrument

692
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:47,127
and we noticed that we are indeed
hitting 60 frames per second

693
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:51,114
that's great and check out the device
utilization

694
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:55,983
you know we are now in like the
mid-thirties as opposed to

695
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,640
you know both mid-seventies before are

696
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:02,105
so this this is great you know less
chief you work means we're hitting a

697
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:04,022
performance targets

698
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:08,060
and also means better battery life so
that's a good thing

699
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:11,083
so awesome can we ship it now arm

700
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:15,082
not just yet we still have one more
device: we should look at

701
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:18,139
so with take a look an iPhone 4s and see
how

702
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,044
scrolling is with her new changes now so

703
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:25,096
we are in fact in 60 frames per second
that's good

704
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:29,140
and again device utilization seem sane
me a 30 percent is a lot better than

705
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:31,071
mid-seventies

706
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:36,081
so to summarize when we had coronation

707
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:40,113
doing in figure 100 shadow for us

708
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:44,109
are you notice there's a drop of when
you look at older devices

709
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:48,015
so the iPhone 5s can handle this no
problem

710
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:51,106
but as you look at the iPhone 5 the
iPhone 4s the iPhone iPod Touch

711
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:55,102
you notice that performance drops off
because again all the devices can handle

712
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:59,023
the amount of green passes the newer
devices can

713
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:02,087
and when we make this change in take
advantage the shadow path property

714
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:05,105
you know notice we're hitting our target
everywhere for 60 frames per second

715
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:09,087
so this was good we can ship this and
happy covers so

716
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:12,126
after we can finally shipped so

717
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:16,052
in summary of screen passes are
expensive

718
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,061
you know you always want to use
coronation instruments to find out if

719
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:20,081
you had any unnecessary

720
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:23,154
our screen passes and no the API's in
the view hierarchy that you're using

721
00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:27,063
to understand first thing you can do to
avoid in this case

722
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:31,072
it was using shadow and as always you
know measure performance across multiple

723
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:33,056
devices

724
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:36,147
you know you can see what the Jeep you
utilization is by looking at the OpenGL

725
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,051
ES driver internet

726
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:42,094
and you can see with the CPU is up to by
using the time profiler instrument

727
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:46,061
and as always you know again know your
view our keynote any hidden costs for

728
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:47,121
what your

729
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:51,034
for what you're trying to render and
this is especially true for things we

730
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:52,090
have inside a people who sells

731
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:55,052
because we want to ensure that we have
smooth scrolling so it is particularly

732
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:59,117
important with York you build up in the
people who saw

733
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:04,085
so next case anyone looking at is a
fictitious contact application

734
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:07,091
so again this is just a simple table
view we have

735
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:11,097
you know around from now and we have
online attacks

736
00:40:11,097 --> 00:40:14,141
so not a whole lot going on here so

737
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,116
if we look at performance across
different devices we notice that you

738
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,025
know the iPhone 5s the oven vibrating 60
frames per second

739
00:40:22,006 --> 00:40:25,021
that's good but the iPhone 4s the iPod
Touch

740
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:28,095
are quite there so you know again we
want everybody to have a good user

741
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,179
experience regardless if the hardware
that are you think so

742
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,153
let's take a look at this and see why
we're not getting the target frame rate

743
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,099
on these devices

744
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,156
so first thing I want to do is take an
open field museum delia's drive

745
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:41,133
arrangement

746
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,095
and take a trace you know it's always
good to know where you're starting to

747
00:40:44,095 --> 00:40:47,123
the you understand how the changes you
make are affecting performance

748
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:51,032
so take a trace notice there are
strolling

749
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,117
is you know only in the mid-forties it's
not good

750
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:58,026
and look at the device realization that
way she was asians really high here

751
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:03,016
arm thats rather interesting again
because we're just rendering a couple

752
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:07,047
you know images and syntax so that that
that that would that look suspicious to

753
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:07,055
me

754
00:41:08,027 --> 00:41:11,092
so we'll take a closer look again you
know we use the coronation instrument

755
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:14,157
and see if there's any unnecessary or
unexpected of green passes

756
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:18,075
so you know we noticed the images here
are

757
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:22,103
incurring often passes so kinda curious
let's take a look at how we are

758
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:23,072
rendering

759
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:28,077
and how we are setting up these round
thumbnails

760
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:32,057
so basically what we're doing is we're
starting off this particular case

761
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:35,082
we're starting off with Square
thumbnails and we are on the fly

762
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:38,126
asking for a donation to round them off
for us and we're doing this by using

763
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:40,084
corner radius unmasking

764
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:43,093
on so this is worthy of being passes are
coming from so

765
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:46,107
you know again anything that we can do
to avoid on screen passes

766
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:50,070
you know will improve performance across
all devices

767
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,026
so is therefore is there a better way to
do this I

768
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,089
ideally if you can't regenerate your
family else round

769
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:58,175
then that would be great because and you
just be rendering images and you

770
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:01,077
wouldn't be trying to do all of this

771
00:42:01,077 --> 00:42:04,112
masking having all these often passes on
the fly

772
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:08,088
so you know if you can pre generate them
that's great

773
00:42:08,088 --> 00:42:12,107
if you can then another trick you could
do is remember this

774
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:16,073
you I was just away table view with
white people who sells and just you know

775
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:17,084
white background

776
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:21,112
so we could fake it in this case you
know we could render the square content

777
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:25,100
for the square from now and then render
a waiting for to circle on top a bit too

778
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,049
kinda

779
00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:29,076
you know in essence cutaway the rest to
the image on

780
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:31,083
this will be reducing our on screen
passes but the increasing the amount a

781
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:32,143
blending

782
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:36,120
you know but it still turns out to be a
nap performance when because the Jeep

783
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:37,089
you can plan

784
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:41,009
a lot faster than it can do on screen
passes so

785
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:44,014
let's make this change %uh just doing
the

786
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:48,028
you know faking and see how that affects
performance

787
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:51,031
so will take an open to release driver
will take tracing your

788
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:55,080
she leaves driver instrument to refrain
readers and sure enough we're getting 60

789
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,820
frames per second

790
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:59,082
and notice how much last the device
utilization

791
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:02,165
so again we're 30 percent verses you
know mid to upper eighties

792
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:06,122
on one quick word on this on you notice
before

793
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:09,911
you're actually keep you down but we
weren't actually a hundred percent for

794
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:11,240
Jeep you time

795
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:14,060
that's because you know when you have
%ah screen passes there is a idle time

796
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:17,085
when the Jeep you have to change
contacts or do you switch contacts

797
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:21,073
so you know you still might be cheap you
down but not quite

798
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:25,119
hitting 100 percent CPU usage because
the situation with fostering passes so

799
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:26,056
that's

800
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:30,102
something to keep in mind so if we
summarize performance across

801
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:34,841
all the devices you know before we were
just using masking

802
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,920
we notice that there was a point drop
off on all devices

803
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:41,126
on after we made this change you know
and we made the trade offer doing having

804
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:44,063
more blending for last on screen passes

805
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:47,104
we are now hitting 60 frames per second
everywhere which is which is good this

806
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:50,026
is what we want

807
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:53,048
so in summary notice there's a theme
here

808
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:58,063
I often passes are expensive so you know
again you can use coronation to find

809
00:43:58,063 --> 00:43:59,090
where you have any unexpected

810
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:02,071
of green passes and you know it's always
good to know your API

811
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:06,145
and what you using do to avoid them on
and of course you know

812
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:10,110
always measure performance across
different devices you know OpenGL ES

813
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:14,002
truck OpenGL ES driver instrument will
give you GPUs

814
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:18,021
activity and time profile arrangement
will show you CPU activity

815
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,087
and again you know always know what your
view hierarchy is you know if you have

816
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:22,101
any kind of strange

817
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:27,058
or those are looking performance issues

818
00:44:27,058 --> 00:44:29,155
so overall summary you know what were
the questions below our original

819
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:33,067
questions and what will be used to

820
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:36,090
to actually find these answers so here's
a nice little table

821
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:40,070
you know it that shows what we actually
used to get down to the question so

822
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:44,066
this is always a good starting point for
figuring out before you start giving new

823
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:44,070
code

824
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:47,079
try to figure out what's going on is
good to see what's actually happening on

825
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:50,090
device

826
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:53,011
so overall summary on axle

827
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:58,006
talked about the coronation pipeline and
talked about some rendering concepts

828
00:44:58,006 --> 00:45:03,029
and then talked about new UI kit
features for blur and vibrancy a fact

829
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:06,149
and then I went over profiling tools and
then this an example

830
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:11,133
case studies so if you have any
questions feel free to contact you to

831
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:14,126
the apt remarks evangelist or the
developer tools Angeles

832
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:19,032
so feel free to contact Jay per day if
you're curious about coordination

833
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:20,046
documentation

834
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:26,058
that available online as well as the
devil performs as a great resource

835
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:29,063
and other related sessions are happening
at the BBC

836
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:33,147
you might find this interesting so these
might be worth checking out

837
00:45:34,047 --> 00:45:35,686
so thanks and have a wonderful
