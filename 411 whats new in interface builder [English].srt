1
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:16,041
good afternoon everyone are you guys
doing

2
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,147
now

3
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:23,416
battery go I could manage open so that
was on owned

4
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,250
but I want so I this session is called

5
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:30,088
I what's new in Interface Builder as we
were joking earlier maybe

6
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:34,125
what isn't new interface bowler we have
all kinds a great stuff you guys

7
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:38,764
today and so my name is Kevin Kathy and
one in Interface Builder engineers

8
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:43,180
and me in my colleague Quinn will be
joining us later I can be walking you

9
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:43,677
through

10
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,871
sum up what's new now we're gonna show
you some stuff that you

11
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,070
might not have seen yet Rossana go into
more detail about some other things that

12
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:51,013
you

13
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:54,336
have seen so far at this conference so
what we have

14
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:58,033
today is completely falls in a couple
themes themes that you really have to

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,971
and from the US so far in the conference

16
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,070
the first one is is live NIS now to know
about you but I like seeing

17
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:09,024
when I'm working on so as I work on my
code we have teachers to bring

18
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:12,063
your content your code your custom stuff

19
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:15,066
right into the interface for campus I
think we really want to help you guys

20
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:17,118
get to start your vision faster

21
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:22,081
and to have some fun while you get to
you next is adaptability

22
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,118
I'm love this about our platforms is all
the places

23
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,102
that your abs can run let's think about
we got iPhone iPad

24
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:34,081
Portrait Landscape OS 10 iowa's and then
throwing all the languages to you

25
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:37,175
you love getting those bugs that are
like hey this is buggin this language

26
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:38,163
and I look at my cup

27
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:42,065
I haven't heard that language I think
that some that's great about our

28
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,070
platforms as an

29
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:46,029
and as application developers reply all
well aware of this

30
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:49,106
third is power in parity

31
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:54,040
I O S and almost 10 if taken some great
step storyteller this year

32
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:57,059
and I think one of the places that this
is really illustrated best

33
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:00,109
is in interface polar and so we've got
some tools to help you

34
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,013
seamlessly work between a both of our
platforms using really familiar

35
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,056
technologies and workflows

36
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:10,505
so what's your plan for today how how we
gonna do this

37
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,400
well my coworkers are in an app and then
he conveniently

38
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:17,042
left for vacation this weekend so he
didn't have a chance to finish it so

39
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:20,597
were gonna finish perform on stage I'm
is there a nickname

40
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,980
the app is actually about going on
vacation and sharing your photos while

41
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,247
you're on vacation

42
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,230
and rating those and so we really have
to look at my coworkers photos as he

43
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:31,312
enjoyed a drink by the beach

44
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,552
and Quinn I give this presentation so we
have a list oversight see a little

45
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,888
ring and outside is showing the kinda
popularity

46
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,281
that particular destination Hawaii in
London

47
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,040
probably great places got never actually
bend you know those

48
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:50,013
but I New York prolly not the most fun
place to visit

49
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:57,049
must be that the peace that just isn't
as good a Chicago now by tapping on the

50
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,540
site in a slide over your slideshow I
can rate my photos

51
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:06,070
and then here's the iPad version and you
might notice a fuel differences here so

52
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:07,088
for one we have a caption

53
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,148
and into that ratings POW sheik moved
over to the side there

54
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:16,073
I'm also photo nerd so I love to know
how you took your photo

55
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:19,912
so if you capital detailed but you gonna
pop over with some location data on

56
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:20,634
things like

57
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,620
the shutter speed enough stop so

58
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:27,093
I think the best way to do this is just
a jump into a demo and start making this

59
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:28,072
app awesome

60
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,967
alright so I have my storyboard here

61
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,550
and I have a the mockup that I showed
you earlier from my designer this is

62
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,178
kind of a reference and will use that as
we go through our presentation

63
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,894
some terms a strategy and and Scott
starting your app that the thing I like

64
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,760
to do personally as I to get all my
views laid out first

65
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:50,148
and then kinda fill in the custom
content so let's start by adding

66
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,037
constraints for our table he saw here

67
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:57,535
this out this box this list is going to
be our that circle ty love you

68
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,198
that will fill in all that there's a
couple ways to add content and interface

69
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:01,873
bowler

70
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,426
why I can just easily controlled rag to
Avoca spacing constrain

71
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:10,122
for this view I can also use the
constraint pop over here

72
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,021
and this gives me some additional
features reno the pic concentrate on the

73
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:15,180
fly

74
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:18,137
pick a different object to constrain to
things like that

75
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,371
Southern art i love u has got position

76
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,065
and heights what about wit well we can
add an explicit with constraint but then

77
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,720
for real change that highlight he will
use of Google update in all these

78
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:29,831
different spots

79
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,610
so what I really want to express is just
that this view

80
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,096
should have the same with is the same
height this is not new since last year

81
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:40,148
which the military aspect ratios

82
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:44,065
with the towel you now in the in the
spot that we won it was working these

83
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:44,072
labels

84
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,093
sums gonna grab the labels dragging up
in a spot in my in the position here

85
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:52,112
and I can create multiple constraints
that one seizing control drag

86
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:57,059
by holding the Shift or the command key
in a sitting return

87
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:01,103
now if I look back at my mock-up you can
see that

88
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:06,010
the text is really not centered but I'll
be it's it's come at the bottom of the

89
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,025
taxes in the center

90
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:10,037
love this particular target you so now
we can do

91
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:13,131
new since last year's we can actually go
ahead and change the attributes involved

92
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,063
in my constraint

93
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:18,094
but is open up the attributes inspector
for my constraint

94
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:22,143
you can see now I can see the items and
their attributes

95
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:27,043
and I can just go ahead and changes from
center why to bottom

96
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:31,068
which is gonna move it down to the other
side but one thing you'll notice

97
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:35,160
is that didn't do exactly what I
expected so what's going on here

98
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:39,099
all the things that I notice is that I
was thinking about in terms of the label

99
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:44,108
not in terms the view so nothing that
our inspector gives us the ability

100
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:48,104
to reverse the keys to the constraint in
a way that makes sense to you

101
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:53,010
let me and you that change and if I open
it up again

102
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:57,022
icons like reversed first and second
item at this puts the constraint is

103
00:05:57,031 --> 00:06:00,035
mathematically equivalent to the other
constrain but I can't express it in a

104
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:02,092
way that makes sense to me

105
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:05,121
and now i can say okay the labels bottom

106
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:10,039
should be at the views center why

107
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,056
now one field that you might have
noticed here is the multiplier

108
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:16,075
so this is what enables things like
aspect ratios and also proportional

109
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,128
sizing constraints

110
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,101
and as a couple different ways I can
insert a multiplier depending on my

111
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,009
situation

112
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,011
so I'm thinking it about it in terms of
an aspect ratio I could do something

113
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:25,082
like

114
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:28,096
124 and you can see that now that labels

115
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,138
bottom is one is in a ratio of one to
four with the center wire that

116
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,127
might i love you but you know what
fractions might make more sense to me

117
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:40,096
are you the fraction instead so good
just type in a fraction

118
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:45,140
or of course decibel numbers are also
Africa was well

119
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:50,052
so our title labels now in the right
spot close to the sublevel

120
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:54,176
sucking this track is in a position
aum's gonna do two more constraints

121
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:59,085
to get my views all a doubt and I can

122
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,104
show this by resizing my table you now

123
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:07,035
want things I love about getting to show
Xcode is giving you guys a few tips and

124
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:10,036
tricks for being even more productive in
Xcode so this is going to be

125
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:14,106
pro chip number one if I hold shift when
I right click

126
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:18,006
in the campus it'll give me a menu
everything into the mouth

127
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:22,067
at the point that I clicked Savannah
quickly get to my table view cell

128
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,136
I just do that and select the nominee up

129
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:31,078
if I resize my table view cell you can
see those constraints

130
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:37,172
budding exactly what I want I'm ahead on
be that change

131
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:42,135
alright so with our views in place for
ready to start filling in that custom

132
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:43,079
view

133
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,083
and you've already seen a our custom
custom views features are a couple

134
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,090
different times

135
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,011
but I'm gonna do now I'm gonna show you
the steps necessary

136
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:55,004
to have your content showing up in
Interface Builder from start

137
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:58,098
to finish and show you I mean really how
easy it is

138
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:02,121
the first thing we need to do you step 1
to 4 as recreate

139
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:08,038
a custom framework remarks on OS 10 in
our new and I last with I was

140
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,059
8 someone to jump my product editor here

141
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,065
and Melissa target on add a new target

142
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,035
we won a Cocoa Touch framework so I'm
gonna call this

143
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:24,083
site rate kitten ever Abbas the site
rate

144
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:28,095
am choosing to in but this in my eye was
applications in it two things one

145
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:32,151
it in a link my application against this
framework and 21 application built in a

146
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:34,520
copy that framework

147
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,760
into the Apple let's go ahead and create
that framework

148
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:44,095
and that's it I have a custom framework
and its already for me

149
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,810
now step number two and getting your
content to show up in Interface Builder

150
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:48,980
is to create

151
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:52,937
a subclass you I view more an issue if
you're on the Mac

152
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:57,845
sucking this right-click on my group ear
choose new file

153
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,153
I wanna coca touch class I'm gonna call
this

154
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,970
site tile view

155
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:07,776
so classy idea or any you Swift is our
language

156
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,662
so make sure this is add to the right
target will make you at your framework

157
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,040
target

158
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:18,233
and now our class is created so to step
down already

159
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,277
the third step is to tell Interface
Builder that this class

160
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:25,113
can display custom content and interface
bowler

161
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:28,610
and I can do that by Martin the class as
at

162
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:31,270
I B desirable if I Nana

163
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,837
in object if I'm in objective-c

164
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:38,093
the attribute this looks like that

165
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:42,600
so step three is done a class is
desirable our framework is created

166
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:45,475
and the final step is to simply tell
Interface Builder

167
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,480
that and instanceof a above you in my
storyboard

168
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:53,587
should actually be this class something
back to the storyboard

169
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,055
shooting the recent files here

170
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,386
and on the go ahead and select might our
view

171
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:04,505
I open the identity inspector and I can
just type in

172
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,620
that tile you class that I just created

173
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:11,062
you have a similar law to compete for me
and now that's

174
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:14,131
everything I have to do to get my
content showing up in interface polar

175
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,701
it's super super easy now for something
so not because they haven't written the

176
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:18,816
code

177
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:23,610
but were kept their so speaking at what
was actually

178
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:27,093
now go ahead and create some code for
our view so I wanna show the code for my

179
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,352
view side by side of my storyboard

180
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:33,201
and that's really easy about to open my
class

181
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,350
I'm gonna show you another Xcode pro
chip number to you

182
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:41,334
if I options like this file many be no
that'll

183
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,990
open in a new assistant or in a new tab

184
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:48,142
based upon how your preferences are set
but I hold options shift

185
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:52,131
and click I can watch user view

186
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,552
and this user allows me to pick the
destination up where I want this file to

187
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:56,680
open

188
00:10:56,068 --> 00:11:00,347
I can target a new split a new tab a new
window I can even target

189
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,995
splits in tabs are even open so very
very flexible to get

190
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,740
to open the file

191
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:14,773
I'm integrated a new split side by side
with my storyboard

192
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:18,523
alright so there's a couple different
ways that you can create your custom

193
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,430
views

194
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:24,068
and when it burns at today's were gonna
create a custom view by composing at

195
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:27,080
I've smaller components in these
compounds are you there

196
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:30,957
sub use like you I label you an
ImageView or layers

197
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:35,410
morning use layers today if I were to
implement dry rack

198
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,092
that's ok I guess the best performance
whereas using some players and some

199
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:39,181
views is gonna get us

200
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,073
really good performance things go and
delete this code here

201
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,720
and we're gonna start trading our view
if we go back to market here

202
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:51,851
by working on this on these rings on the
outside

203
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:57,580
summer start with this this gray ran in
and fill it in with the colored one

204
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,720
what create a in New shape layer

205
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:04,311
comes for the property you can see if
the mean Erica need

206
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,977
import module for that contains the
coronation classes

207
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:13,153
an hour create this thing a really
convenient place to create this

208
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,279
as in a is an honest is an override love
layouts abuse

209
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,313
for someone to call super which will
make sure to on my studies have the

210
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:22,641
right size

211
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,938
and Anna by having created the
ringleader yet I'm gonna go ahead and

212
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:26,835
create one at it

213
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,900
Tulare my view then of course

214
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,025
wanna make sure that we position in the
right place

215
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,345
now have a Larry Watson let's do
something interesting with them my

216
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,185
clothes the

217
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,795
utility area to get myself a lot more
space

218
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:46,470
so what's crib is a path and we're just
gonna make this be a circle

219
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:49,048
animate set this as the shape I love my

220
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:53,017
shapewear and their interpersonal
they're showing me the result

221
00:12:53,449 --> 00:13:00,449
have my code so far

222
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:04,126
response super fast which is great so
i'd

223
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:08,115
not only one a solid circle right on a
crater rim and sews

224
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:13,018
CA ship player has a feature that allows
minute to struck the outside

225
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:16,027
love the up the path and sauna and turn
off the fill color

226
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:22,027
that align with and set the struggler to
block now because my content is showing

227
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:23,052
live interface Miller

228
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,057
I can see that I'm already made a
mistake flows are you familiar with

229
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:28,044
Betty a path you know that

230
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:32,071
when you have a stroke happen that draws
outside the path unhappy the

231
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:35,100
inside the path so actually wanna inset
my path

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,068
by half for the line with now I know I'm
use my line with the lots with create

233
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:40,153
new property for

234
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,140
and now I can inset my rectangle

235
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:49,092
by that amount and make sure to use in
boss box

236
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:55,034
and now my shape is looking much better
the last thing I want to do is wanna

237
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,050
filled in with that

238
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:59,104
color that our designer gave us all feel
than an and

239
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,054
how it looks much really really light

240
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:06,088
mmm machines this to you .3

241
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:11,184
designers aren't always right certain

242
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:17,172
not hiring layer I I love all our
designers

243
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:21,164
another ring wear for the background
looking pretty good looks with autumn

244
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:22,129
autumn color

245
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,036
obviously the exact same thing pretty
much the only difference I'm gonna do

246
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,126
with other ring layer

247
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:32,087
isn't gonna rotated by 90 degrees so
that when we fill an R rating it's going

248
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:32,169
to come from

249
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:37,098
the top of the circle not other side so
I wanna drive my

250
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:41,123
reshape player now by an actual ratings
let's create a new property

251
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:49,023
which is the rating and now one actually
update or layer based upon its rating so

252
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:50,039
many use the feature apps

253
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,134
I've CA shapewear the Austin is set the
kind of the progress on the stroke

254
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:56,129
I'm gonna do a new method because I'm
gonna call the thrown up by two

255
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:57,115
different spots

256
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:01,067
so one of the spots that

257
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,086
I'm going to call is from its from
changing the rating itself

258
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:07,088
it couldn't be easier now to react to
property changes

259
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:11,087
with sweats new property observers so
all you have to do

260
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,556
is just say that when this rating

261
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,820
did did change I can just go ahead and
call that method

262
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,085
that updates my shapewear

263
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:25,089
and I'm also gonna call it and then if
you're just in case we have an actual

264
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:26,115
change those properties yet

265
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:30,052
and now my ship layers lookin

266
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:35,150
exactly how I want it so far now it's
really common when you creating

267
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:40,070
and different types I love custom views
on have properties that you expose

268
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:44,081
that people can change to defer your
code or even with Interface Builder

269
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:47,163
and interfacial to make that really easy
with a new feature called inspect ables

270
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:51,105
so if I got to mine rating

271
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:55,041
property here and market as IBM's

272
00:15:55,041 --> 00:16:00,088
spectacle this is the flag for interface
better that says hey

273
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:03,145
this property I want you to show in
Interface Builder just like

274
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:09,072
all the other properties but you had it
on your views so I jump back to Xcode

275
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:13,079
and I open the inspector you can see
that rating is

276
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:17,087
is shown up and I can edit it and it
reflects instantly

277
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:24,087
in the campus you might be wondering

278
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,130
what can I use of Instructables you can
use

279
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:34,050
all kinda different prop different types
for Instructables

280
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:38,118
by the way in spectacles works is that
you might wanna we're we're just all the

281
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:40,027
data gets stored

282
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:43,119
and spectacle takes advantage up the
user-defined runtime:

283
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,020
attributes that we've had for couple
releases their Facebook her

284
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,118
you can see that the rating I just set a
showing up here

285
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:55,103
now it's important that we are using
user-defined on hand after beachfront

286
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:59,030
spectacle because it means that you
don't have to worry about where to store

287
00:16:59,003 --> 00:16:59,087
this data

288
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:03,103
and how to encode it we take care all
that for you at design-time

289
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:09,076
and at one time the different types that
I can use sprint spectrum or anything

290
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,077
supported by user-defined runtime:
attributes

291
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:14,078
bullion strings numbers be

292
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,107
valuable like him points and sizes and
racks in

293
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:25,007
even images which is new this year

294
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,041
love it so instructive laws are I think
are great for exposing properties a view

295
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,137
that you can edit

296
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:35,133
but I think it's also really helpful for
helping you

297
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:39,117
developed your views so there's there's
two ways that I see this

298
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,276
the first thing as it helps you to
validate the changes that you're making

299
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,504
especially easy experimenter ng with new
types of things

300
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:52,250
so I wanna change the color my rating
based upon how good that rating is

301
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:55,110
red means you can better catch up angry
maybe

302
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:59,003
well done so let's go ahead and change
the

303
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:03,060
the the color a bar stroke based upon
that rating and I'm using a new

304
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:07,099
switch statement and swift to accomplish
this

305
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,106
and I can see the Interface Builder is
doing

306
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,100
the right thing in terms the color now
I'm a switchback interface Plus ICANN

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,032
edit the inspector bill and I'm gonna
show you Xcode project

308
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:22,114
number three I like to navigate summed a
lot of times without the mouse

309
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:26,032
and I can't jump around with in Xcode
and put the focus in different

310
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:29,107
editors using command J

311
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:33,030
if I had command J give me a little
chooser and I can pick which

312
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:36,057
editor I wanna have focused so in this
case I wanna jump focus back

313
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:39,088
to the interface with the editor so I
can just go ahead McMahon J

314
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:42,166
a pic to primary return and now you can
see I'm seeing my inspectors

315
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:46,132
from her face further I can jump to New
the attributes inspector with Command

316
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:47,101
Option

317
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,078
for not killed in focus and I can

318
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:54,086
tryout our colors and everything looks
to be behaving

319
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:58,129
as expected

320
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,037
now the the next place that I can a

321
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,037
that I can use in spectacles in terms of

322
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:09,096
in terms of a playing with my views is
is also in just

323
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:13,210
X spearmint thing with different types
the values

324
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:16,075
so I haven't decided yet on my on my
line with im

325
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:19,744
10 might work it might not be the right
thing so what smart that as inspector

326
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,370
Paul

327
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,096
I'm gonna jump back Interface Builder
using command J

328
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:28,164
that line with the showing up in my
service try new value 12 low then is

329
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:30,093
pretty thick

330
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,510
to assist known come back down here five
little small

331
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:38,079
not sex sickle pretty good to me so very
very easy to Xperia man

332
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,081
with your custom views when using them
with an interface bowler

333
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,190
now I'm also gonna show you just how
live these views are

334
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,690
gonna go ahead and resize my table you
again

335
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:53,077
and you can see as on resizing it it's
just

336
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:56,165
perfectly real redrawing my view its
interacting with that just like

337
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:01,129
any other view that's an inner science
and Interface Builder

338
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,055
may go ahead and and undo that change

339
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:08,060
okay so our rings are looking pretty
good let's go ahead and fill not image

340
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,033
someone to create a new

341
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,153
layer for my image montana declare
property that I can set from my code

342
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:15,058
update the image

343
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:19,152
now I wanna put in image in there and so

344
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:23,370
let's go ahead and set that on our lair
might come back down to our

345
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:26,059
lehrer properties here

346
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,081
and actually and on the thing I wanna

347
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:33,129
create this inside there are property so
what's actually go ahead and do that

348
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:38,098
enough create the lair for somebody that
inside a bar layouts abuse

349
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:41,121
it's looking a lot better as a better
place to do it blood update it down here

350
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:42,080
in our

351
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:46,010
our lair properties so you can see her
face bowlers

352
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,066
on doing as I'm just done drawing a
square and I'm drawing a circle masking

353
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:50,071
it

354
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,017
and now we can set image as the contents

355
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:57,027
up that squarely are behind

356
00:20:57,027 --> 00:21:00,112
so what's getting image to set inside if
you're now

357
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:05,061
I don't wanna ship any images with my
actual

358
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:08,088
framework the images that I use for
testing right is that would just blow

359
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:09,163
the framework

360
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:13,080
what I'd like to do is be able to
reference an image it's in my project

361
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:14,065
without actually putting it

362
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:18,054
in a target and Interface Builder
provides

363
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:21,062
a great place to do this in a great way
to do this through prepare for interface

364
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,069
polar

365
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:26,128
so this is a method but it's called
after you your

366
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:30,083
views are initialized incentive
Interface Builder and allowed me to do

367
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,152
any kind design time setup

368
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:35,126
against only gets called the design-time
now I have some

369
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:39,113
images in my products and test images
unleashed onto you

370
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:43,044
over here in this folder and these are
in any target their descent images that

371
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:46,051
my designers gave me to help me test to
make sure that my app is doing the right

372
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:46,139
thing

373
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,039
wanna go on reference wannabes by owner
so I could I could pass a

374
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,113
you know an absolute path then generate
image but i wanna do in a way to make

375
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,032
sense for my entire team

376
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,120
so Interface Builder will actually pass
the paths

377
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:04,027
to your projects through the environment

378
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:07,069
and allow you to actually take advantage
have

379
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:10,076
the resources in your project

380
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:13,104
so let's go back here and let's go ahead

381
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:18,005
and look at what that looks like so
inventive our environment there's an IV

382
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:20,022
project source directories

383
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:23,060
string that's just a bunch of product
directories

384
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:26,059
concatenated with the colon and I can
split those up

385
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,048
and go ahead and actually get the
strings

386
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:34,055
so I only have one project path summers
gonna go ahead and grab the first one

387
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:37,086
and I can get the path relative to my
project

388
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:41,182
just by a pending that test images and
that that image name

389
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:45,105
and then we can go ahead and create the
image

390
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:49,083
and it should him it should show up

391
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:53,912
here any second hi well this isn't
exactly looking right to me i i think a

392
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:55,690
a

393
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:59,076
I think I musta missed something gonna
be great if I could do but my view right

394
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:00,155
McAmis

395
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:04,152
well with my views you can so I'm gonna
set a breakpoint

396
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:09,127
on my image here go back to interface to
learn slut might how do you

397
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:15,028
and from the editor menu I can to select
debug selected views

398
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:18,045
and this is going to attached to
Interface Builder

399
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:21,046
and allow me to actually debug might be
did

400
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:25,654
debug my custom you just like any other
debug session

401
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:29,225
so I can see here the the looks like I'm
getting inside here some I'm getting the

402
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,936
project path

403
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:35,000
let's go ahead and not let's go ahead
and sand step over

404
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,089
not see it but the images you can see
the LDB is automatically praying out the

405
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,108
fact that this is an optional tight at
the optional hide actually has something

406
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:43,847
in it

407
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,640
footsie with that images and yep sure
enough we got image

408
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:52,076
so what's going wrong here only put a
breakpoint

409
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:55,099
reaction center image contents and the
to continue

410
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:58,288
and hmm interesting

411
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:03,530
mother never actually gets call but I
must be doing is a must-have for Don to

412
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:03,059
actually

413
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:08,047
update my image property when are my
image layer when the image property

414
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,736
changes

415
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,500
if I stroll up now yup sure enough I
forgot to use

416
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:16,010
a property observer to make sure that my
image

417
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,076
prop layers and get updated when image
changed and there you go

418
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:24,110
so Interface Builder provides lot two
different ways

419
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:28,800
for you to be able to design your views
using my prepare for Interface Builder

420
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,925
knees I B project source directories

421
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,790
you can see your custom images you can
you can debug them

422
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:40,688
but there's even more you can do let's
go ahead and close the deal by Gary here

423
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:45,402
I'm gonna jump over to different view
controller now

424
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,460
and we have this rating view which is
showing us the number of stars

425
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:51,047
for are particular image now this

426
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:55,055
rating view has an inspector Paul it's
called star rating

427
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,036
I'm gonna go ahead and change this to
3.5

428
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:03,069
and when I zoom back out and zoom
instead on our rating layer

429
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:07,121
you can see now now that that that label
there's overlapping

430
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:13,480
our star well why is that well we have
this explicit width and height constrain

431
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:17,510
so that the rating he doesn't have a
chance to grow to whatever size it is

432
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:21,132
sotsass go and delete this we need 'em

433
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:25,104
so can delete those not Interface
Builder is hopefully telling me

434
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:29,643
that my views and the US it doesn't have
enough constraints

435
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,310
now for those you familiar with on a
layout you know that there's a method

436
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,380
called intrinsic content size which
allows reduced the fine

437
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,390
a size to fit size from my view why can
take advantage in that

438
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,123
right inside interface bother if we go
back to our

439
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:47,106
we got our rating view class and I'm
gonna ok not using open quickly

440
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,049
site rating view and use my little

441
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,134
option shift to target the assistant
here

442
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:59,102
most drawn to the bottom of the file at
our new could

443
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:03,038
sovereign are intrinsic on inside method
and now

444
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,087
Interface Builder is 12 recognized that
matter there it's gonna call just like

445
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,452
it normally would at runtime and now
it's showing me

446
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:16,450
that my view can grow to fill the size
the stars and the interns account in

447
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:16,774
size

448
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,220
my label and I can just put it right the
place

449
00:26:20,022 --> 00:26:23,028
and it's also time with my view is now
no longer ambiguous

450
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:27,071
I'm all good to go its executing my code
and use in and turned the content size

451
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:27,163
override

452
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:31,121
to figure out which constraints need to
be there

453
00:26:32,021 --> 00:26:36,048
now for those who are pixel
perfectionists you might realize

454
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:39,049
but that caption is actually one point
of

455
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:43,070
from this label on terms are being
aligned

456
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:47,010
I'd like to be able to align these two
things by their baseline but

457
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,669
my rating due to the custom you have
stuff inside the villa how to lie

458
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:55,030
aligned by the baseline what can
override another

459
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:58,048
method on an on you I'd even an issue

460
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:01,071
called you for baseline layout and I'm
gonna return the label

461
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:05,147
thats internal to my custom view and now
Interface Builder is showing me

462
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:09,083
that this view now has a baseline
running right to the baseline

463
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:14,119
my label and if I delete the centering
in three I might caption

464
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:18,082
I can this dragon here and you can see
it snapping right to the baseline

465
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:21,111
that custom view that I just created
entirely

466
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:29,011
in code

467
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:32,059
not go ahead and finish this off by
baseline

468
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:36,081
aligning these to you to these two views

469
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:40,148
so it'll look and see you using live
using some other things that you can use

470
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:43,967
to make some really cool he was I'm
really looking for to seeing what you

471
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,210
guys

472
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:48,096
what you guys do sup

473
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,120
the four steps that you need to do to
get your custom content and Interface

474
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:52,008
Builder

475
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:56,107
one create a framework wanted to create
a framework in the first place

476
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,540
the way that this feature works is that
when you define a class is designed a

477
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:01,683
ble

478
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:05,260
interface dollars going to build your
friend Mark target

479
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:09,038
to launch hopper process gonna
dynamically load your framework into

480
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:10,060
that whole process

481
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:13,018
and then interact with that and this
also helps

482
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:17,095
keep you from the mistakes that least
that I make while writing code

483
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:21,098
which is something like a crash that way
you don't have to you can see what the

484
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:24,100
areas were having to suffer from it

485
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,079
secondly you create a subclass a view I
view

486
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,134
either with objective-c or was swept

487
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:36,097
third you mark it as desirable I wanted
to say a quick note about

488
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:39,286
and spectacles well while desirable

489
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,360
is a feature of this custom views
feature you can use inspector balls

490
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:48,057
with out having a desirable class you
can add Inspector Morse to any of your

491
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:48,886
classes

492
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:52,290
but you interact with an interface
Miller and most traders properties in

493
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,031
the inspector

494
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,728
and finally you just hook up your custom
view with

495
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,216
the classic you just created live you'd
like to do all kinds of things you can

496
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:03,940
see your custom drawing

497
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:07,063
you can have custom John a tree interact
with that one that I didn't show you can

498
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:08,007
also provide

499
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:13,270
the line it wrecked insets that are on
both I was a nice tan

500
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:17,406
you gonna bite your views right McAmis
and you can also use several mechanisms

501
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:19,750
for interacting with your co design-time

502
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:22,744
I showed you prepare for interface
bowler but another one is this target

503
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:23,495
conditional

504
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,820
target interface bother and you can use
this with pound F

505
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:30,110
cue either opt code in or out of my
views

506
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:34,076
so for example you might have some
server connection code that you don't

507
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,109
wanna run when you're

508
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:41,073
incentive interface bowler sickness opt
out using the target conditional

509
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:45,101
out to show you some new our layout
features since last year

510
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,027
now we want to do is we want to add
iPhone support to our

511
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:52,094
our application my coworkers had time
for iPad support

512
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,130
and our goal is that we use a single
story board to do this and this is made

513
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,074
possible because it a feature called

514
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,032
size classes size classes the future I
was

515
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:06,046
a.m. Xcode 6 the largest specify how
your view controller near you I adapt

516
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:09,064
as the available size for your view
controller changes

517
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:12,113
well let me win it I'll walking through
an example what's the story with some

518
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:16,097
you control over some with some size and
it grows to some new size

519
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,149
what's important here is not the point
size

520
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:23,055
I love your view controller either in
the smaller bigger

521
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:28,022
configuration what's important is the
magnitude of the change

522
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:32,113
small verses big this magnitude is
called a size class

523
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:37,039
a size cost and have one of two values:
compact think small

524
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,070
a regular think bigger any given time a
view controller is gonna have to size

525
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:42,014
classes

526
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:46,012
one horizontally and one berkeley making
a

527
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:50,115
total number of combinations for saw
them in a concrete example

528
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:55,107
so I have are you I hear and when we're
in landscape on the iPhone I do like

529
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:57,022
that bottom bar

530
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:01,110
to tighten up a little bit to make more
room for those those images

531
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:06,052
so we can do is in the configurations
are four configurations

532
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:10,066
for where that bar are where the new
controller is in a more compact

533
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,133
Berkel environment we can to set that
constant the thirty

534
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:17,041
and the bigger one thing to 52 iraqi
right

535
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:21,072
well kind of if you notice I have to
specify the value twice

536
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:24,115
and this is gonna make it really hard to
make and it's in the future you make

537
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:29,040
hard to maintain my app is ever gonna
make a change and make it into places

538
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:32,072
so Interface Builder exposes a third
value in a size class called any

539
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:36,061
and any is simply as its name suggests

540
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:40,083
either on the size classes so I can say
that I want that 32b for

541
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:43,088
any horizontal class I don't care what
the witness

542
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:48,109
all i care is about the height which is
compact what the fifty-two

543
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:53,968
well I could also put it in any for
regular but we're I really wanna put it

544
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:58,630
is an any any this is the default
configuration

545
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:01,602
this says that it doesn't matter which
device or which

546
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:06,520
oren tation what the site in my view
controllers I want to use these values

547
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:09,076
and this from the really important
strategy is your divine that designing

548
00:32:09,076 --> 00:32:10,495
your applications

549
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,278
you wanna do as much homework in any any
as possible

550
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:18,320
and then use branch out to those more a

551
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:21,101
more specific configurations as needed
and this is going to make your app

552
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:26,019
much more maintainable and much more
adaptable

553
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,024
now that's great if you can become
really familiar because this is a

554
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:30,134
actually exactly how we expose switching

555
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:34,060
between the different configurations
inside the tax code

556
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:38,070
and let me show you how that works
alright so we're back in our our lovely

557
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,107
story more here

558
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:44,986
and the first thing I'm gonna do in the
storyboard unable five classes

559
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:50,070
me go ahead and open up the documents
factor here and check size classes now

560
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,016
two things are going to happen

561
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:54,103
one if your document isn't using our
layout we're gonna try an all out for

562
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:55,120
your

563
00:32:56,002 --> 00:33:00,003
and then secondly it's going to upgrade
all your segways to the new

564
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:04,083
adaptive segways nama talk about that
all that

565
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:07,175
sore enable size classes and immediately
we're seeing the result the designing

566
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:11,075
and it's great flexible adaptable
environment

567
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:14,161
are you can chars are showing a square
to help reinforce that you're not as any

568
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:15,138
for a specific

569
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:20,069
spur tickler device but rather for the
public their size

570
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:24,095
are magnitude of size a view controller

571
00:33:24,095 --> 00:33:27,099
so the first thing that we want to do is
wanna take that bar and make it a little

572
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:28,076
sis

573
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:31,091
a little bit narrower or shorter I

574
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:34,093
when are height is one hour

575
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:38,015
sinus go ahead and put the canvas into

576
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:40,710
a configuration are gonna do that so
this is the first thing with size

577
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:42,000
classes

578
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,076
is transitioning through the different
configurations it's really easy

579
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:50,076
if I open up this control here in the
bottom of the campus

580
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:52,141
you can see was that grid that we're
seeing earlier in this lovely the pic

581
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,670
which configuration and adding

582
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,770
when I pick a configuration data its
gonna resize the view controllers

583
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,346
for that particular configuration to
reflect that and now

584
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,140
any edits that I make inside this
particular configuration

585
00:34:05,014 --> 00:34:08,071
will be customized for that
configuration

586
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:11,153
let's go ahead and do that now further
the constant the high constant on our

587
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:13,076
bar

588
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:16,094
thank you handsome like this now I could
double-click to edit this constraint but

589
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:18,102
its element it is I'm gonna open a site
inspector

590
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:22,923
and you can see here all the constraints
for my bar

591
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:26,673
well I really just wanna see the ones
that are being defined by my parent to

592
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,470
composition and size this summer's gonna

593
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:32,064
filter the constraints down to those

594
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:37,078
and furthermore was gonna look at size
constraints

595
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:40,097
then to change the constant just click
once

596
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:44,540
type in 30 return and now I've customize
my bar

597
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:51,054
for any compact

598
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:58,160
you can see the result that if I switch
back to any any here

599
00:34:58,016 --> 00:35:02,023
and jabar grew back to that taller
height so really really easy

600
00:35:02,023 --> 00:35:05,071
to make customization between
configurations now the second thing

601
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:06,166
about size classes I want to say is

602
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:10,160
well what's customizable between
configurations therefore things that are

603
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:13,012
customizable between configurations

604
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:16,153
one that can change a constraint
constant to have to change the font

605
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:20,094
3 I can change the whole sets the
constraints I can turn off an entire

606
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:21,142
city constraints a

607
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:25,056
my portrait constraints and turn on a
whole other set say my landscape

608
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,063
constraints

609
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:31,062
and forth I can also customize sub use
turning them honor of this is different

610
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:31,761
from hidden

611
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:35,700
wanna do is just hidden it still
participating in layout

612
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:39,034
but when I uninstall the constraint
using soccer the using size classes

613
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:43,153
actually takes out in the view hierarchy
so I can have new supply constraints

614
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:47,091
forty an example that now what I don't
have a lot of

615
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:51,122
horizontal space I wanna turn off this
rating

616
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:55,064
so I'm gonna go ahead but the campus
into you

617
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:58,075
compact with an I don't really care what
I did is it can

618
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:01,112
not be as tall or short is is that is it
needs to be

619
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:05,017
and you can see for a while at that
looks pretty bad

620
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:10,066
so it's going internet caption of when I
wanna turn to subdue of a configuration

621
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:13,122
its really just as easy as turning off
the constraints that configuration and

622
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:16,051
then turn in the view of itself

623
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:19,112
when I use the constraint commands are
in this menu they're gonna apply again

624
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,075
for just this configuration

625
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:24,079
let's go ahead just clear the concerns
for this view and now we can

626
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,175
uninstall from this configuration I can
do this using the inspector on a per

627
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:28,084
view instance

628
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:32,070
or really quick shortcut for not done is
just

629
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:36,011
command early and command early will
just turn off in its configuration

630
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:42,032
delete will delete it and all the
configurations

631
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:45,064
I also wanna go ahead and remove those
constraints I can dislike the constraint

632
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:48,135
command early not turn it off and I can
add new constraints for justice

633
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:49,984
configuration

634
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:54,560
so I'd like to take this rating view in
a line it horizontally in my container

635
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:58,118
how many use the new are not the new
they had just the existing alignment pop

636
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:00,053
over here

637
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:04,067
much use horizontal Center in container
I'm not change when these

638
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:07,149
monitors update frames nice mind on
wanting what this is

639
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:11,124
this allows when you're adding you can
new constraints the

640
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:15,353
values that you're an ass constraints
for might not be the actual values that

641
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,569
are currently reflected in the canvas
for example I wanna adCenter

642
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,190
in my bottom bar but Mike view clearly
isn't centered on the bottom bar

643
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:24,094
so I can tell interface with her hey
when you add these constraints just go

644
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,243
ahead and put the views

645
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:29,166
and those new locations another these
options allow me to do

646
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:33,670
all frames just it update it for the
whole view controller and items at new

647
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:33,152
constraints

648
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:36,120
this is helpful if you're in the middle
of doing a lot of different constraint

649
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:39,055
surgery and you just wanna move one or
two news

650
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:42,662
but I do in this case menu all the
frames in my view controller

651
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:46,890
you can see at that constrain crushed
and it slides that rating view

652
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:49,538
right on over

653
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,940
and if we go back to any any wallach

654
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:57,110
with customized are interface across two
different configurations

655
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:02,014
very very easily and let's see what this
looks like at runtime

656
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:08,045
I don't build run my application

657
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:12,071
there showing up I can rotate it you can
see that bars automatically adjusting

658
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:17,167
and on iPhone because its compact you
can see that that caption isn't showing

659
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:21,116
now one thing I haven't talked about her
pointed out yet is it may be something

660
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:24,028
you guys are wondering you're saying hey
you headed

661
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:28,297
you have an iPad storyboard wait a
second I thought but you can sure in

662
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,910
there I saw that you had to replace a
great other you had a popover segue

663
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:35,175
how's that working on iphone what the
new adaptive view controller API

664
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:40,129
in iowa's 8 all the wonderful system
classes that you've come to know and

665
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:41,076
love

666
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:45,123
work on both iPad an iPhone and the way
that it works is that they adapt their

667
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,025
environment based upon that available
size:

668
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:53,043
so for example are split you controller
incentive showing side by side because

669
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:54,098
the environment is more compact

670
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,144
it's actually it's gonna push my detail
onto my master

671
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,119
when I'm in a more compact environment
like an iPhone

672
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:05,083
similarly with my popover segue

673
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,592
into being a pop over an iPhone it's
been turned into

674
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:13,790
a model without me writing any code and
this has to do with those new

675
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:19,135
adaptive segue types let's take a look
at those now

676
00:39:20,035 --> 00:39:23,274
device like this popover segue here

677
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,662
and go over to the attributes inspector
you can see it when a new present as pop

678
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:29,950
over segue Smith won a new adapter
segways

679
00:39:29,095 --> 00:39:32,192
let's take a look at other adaptive
segways we have show as a replacement

680
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,143
for example for push

681
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:38,139
and what show in show detail does is it
looks at the context that your end the

682
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:39,116
decide

683
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:44,053
what to do so for example a spot you
can't rely on iPad can actually replace

684
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:45,067
the detail if you have

685
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:49,133
Avery a show detail but an iPhone its
gonna push that

686
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:54,292
detail side onto the master now it's
really cool about this

687
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:59,640
at this is dead accomplished by using
two new you I view controller selectors

688
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,072
showed you control and show detail view
controller you can

689
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:06,076
override these for custom containers and
you can designers containers in

690
00:40:07,012 --> 00:40:08,751
Interface Builder senator segways

691
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:13,040
and it's just going to work at runtime

692
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:16,012
dinner two types are present morally in
print as pop over

693
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:19,018
and these are using the present new
controller

694
00:40:19,072 --> 00:40:22,691
API into the present model view
controller that was allowed to take

695
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,790
advantage of the new

696
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,090
presentation controller ATI

697
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:30,058
which is a new object when you use
present you control or you can do things

698
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:31,104
like

699
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:36,303
make sure that the custom transitions
that you have are all coordinated

700
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:40,366
along with the animations which is
really really great

701
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:43,630
sewer use profanities popover which will
allow

702
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:46,072
our presentation you controller

703
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:50,150
to automatically adapts now if I go back
to mine

704
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:55,094
storyboard here you can see there's
there's no button for closing this

705
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:59,650
and so I could if I had time I could go
ahead and add this

706
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:02,077
and you're welcome back on the labs and
I'll show you how to do this but with

707
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:04,376
the new adaptive you controller API

708
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:09,094
but I can do as I can take advantage up
some other overriding delegate methods

709
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:12,365
to do things like for example in this
case I can say when this pop over

710
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:16,740
segue gets fired go ahead unwrapped love
you can show that you're presenting

711
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:20,139
in a navigation controller at a bar item
and then just an iPhone its initial Mia

712
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:21,126
Done button

713
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:25,029
that I can use to close my close that
modal view controller

714
00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:30,090
but one on iPad maturing as a popover
why don't need that so what show it

715
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:34,010
very very cool for being able to create
great gaps between both

716
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,049
iPhone and iPad

717
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:42,092
3 talked about size classes and again
size classes a

718
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:45,101
really great technology they'll make it
really easy for you guys

719
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:49,001
to create these experiences both for
iPhone and iPad

720
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:52,090
all within the same story board I also
talked about the new

721
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,060
adaptive segue types and we really want
you guys to use his new adapter segue

722
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,240
types consider make your application

723
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:02,680
be able to you hands as their name
suggests adapted very easily

724
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:05,101
between a different types of
environments them I run in out a point

725
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:06,010
that you can use

726
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:09,177
custom content you can create custom in
Tanner's and use those use those schoen

727
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:11,169
show detail view controller methods

728
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:15,164
to customize exactly how those you can
charge a mere presented

729
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:20,108
you have a sliding view controller some
might that you can build all that now

730
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:25,727
with an interface bother what I want to
do now is have my colleague can come up

731
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:28,801
you can show you even more stuff at noon
if it smaller and hopefully tell them

732
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:29,880
better job than I did

733
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:36,088
Quinn

734
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:40,750
cry thank you Kevin someone is Quinn
Taylor I'm also an engineer

735
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:43,394
on the Interface Builder team such a
fantastic team and I hope you can feel

736
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:47,000
how much hard work we've done to bring
to you guys will love these new features

737
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,081
and I can't wait to tell you about a few
more them

738
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:52,160
so first I for one talked about asset
catalogs we introduced asset catalogs

739
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:54,058
last year with Xcode 5

740
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:58,087
and they're fantastic way to manage
resources inside your application

741
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:01,146
both for I O S and 40 S 10 won the first
new features

742
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:06,072
that we've added to asset catalogs in a
2006 is support for size classes

743
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:09,921
as kevin has just been demonstrating to
you you can easily adapt your user

744
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:11,200
interface

745
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:14,090
for compact a regular height or width
now noticed that we have new field in

746
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:15,079
the inspector

747
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,101
when you've selected image yes a catalog
that allow you to customize the same way

748
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:23,088
now if you select on these for example
will customize on compact with

749
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:26,277
you'll see the new rose appear that
allow me to optionally specify

750
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:31,560
new images that will be used if I'm in a
compact with scenario

751
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:35,085
so any images that you don't actually
specify for a specific configuration

752
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:36,460
will be inherited

753
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:39,073
from a specific configuration just as
kevin was talking about with

754
00:43:39,073 --> 00:43:42,150
any any so is a fantastic feature
die-cast mice

755
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:47,026
second alignment support so there may be
occasions where you have an image

756
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,076
provided to you by a designer

757
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:52,027
that doesn't fill the entire space if
the image for example may have a glow

758
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:52,093
effect

759
00:43:52,093 --> 00:43:55,106
are some other padding that did that
because it to be inset

760
00:43:56,006 --> 00:43:59,071
and now you can also the show that
information convey that

761
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:03,390
inside interface builder any asset
catalogs and this will correspond to the

762
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:07,058
alignment wrecked properties on either
an S image for you I image

763
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,470
and you can specify alignments from any
the four edges the fantastic

764
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:16,396
and next is image formats so when we
launched ethic headlines last year

765
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:20,690
we supported PNG images so we've heard
request first thing was added as support

766
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:23,658
for Jay pic images

767
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:27,900
from a you love you to take images this
can be really handy when you have

768
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:29,094
resources that might be large and
compress better with Jay picked in the

769
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:32,102
european chicks you can save space your
application

770
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:37,301
an effort that's great second is PF
vector images and he's a great as well

771
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:40,730
so this estimate value um this is a
fantastic way

772
00:44:40,073 --> 00:44:43,112
tooth to to specify an image that will
scale automatically

773
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:47,067
to your different scales and resolutions
when you're building the an acid

774
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:48,069
catalyst for I West

775
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:51,095
those vector images we're asked arrived
to the correct resolutions and scales

776
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:56,074
at build time on the west end however
their preserved at runtime and I'll even

777
00:44:56,074 --> 00:44:57,085
appear at scale

778
00:44:57,085 --> 00:45:01,304
for printing which as a really cool
bonus and you're also able to mix and

779
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:04,000
match bitmap and vector images

780
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,089
for any particular asset and last to
support for template images

781
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:10,173
Matthew mention this a bit on Monday
template images allow an image to be

782
00:45:11,073 --> 00:45:14,662
to be treated however the stencil in
your in your application

783
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:18,410
so you get kind of a highly a outline
effect

784
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:21,044
and traditionally this is done by
detecting whether the finance and

785
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:21,970
template

786
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:25,960
and now we give you the ability to
override this but default behavior

787
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:28,115
directly in Interface Builder and nasa
catalogs so

788
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:32,394
at suppressing catalogs next you've seen
a few new class and has had about

789
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:36,160
West End from it as visual effects you
is a brand new class

790
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:39,074
in Austin yosemite you've seen a
pervasively for the system by

791
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:40,113
Notification Center

792
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:44,702
behind your your menus and Manjinder
source list and so on

793
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:48,600
you'll see effects like blurring
translucency vibrancy

794
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:51,045
punch their effect in masking and you
can bring these own this

795
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:54,127
the same effect to your own applications

796
00:45:55,027 --> 00:45:58,033
visual effects view is supported
completely in Interface Builder and you

797
00:45:58,033 --> 00:45:59,046
can have your own

798
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:02,365
custom views participate in virus the
effects by overwriting

799
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:06,970
allows vibrancy method on an issue you a
view much more information about how to

800
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:06,165
integrate this

801
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:10,093
definitely check out the session on
adopting new features view I

802
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:13,096
and your semi on video next

803
00:46:13,096 --> 00:46:16,124
you've heard where the new system
fundraise talk about this the great news

804
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,038
is for you

805
00:46:18,038 --> 00:46:21,112
you have to do anything use the system
font it's going to work after next

806
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,231
couple take a review

807
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:26,362
so you don't have any worries on that
front speaking to finance

808
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:32,660
I was custom fonts many view you're
already excited

809
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:36,071
a share your enthusiasm for a couple
releases now you've been able to use

810
00:46:37,016 --> 00:46:38,048
custom fonts

811
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,087
in your IRS applications you can put
them in your project and happened your

812
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:41,144
bundle

813
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:45,123
and now we're adding support for being
able to pick those funds directly in

814
00:46:46,023 --> 00:46:46,110
Interface Builder

815
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:50,054
and have been shot McAmis life for you
so here I just miss fonda they look

816
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:51,071
pretty cool I was 10 brought it over

817
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:55,182
and I can see I can just the metrics and
make sure looks just right without

818
00:46:55,569 --> 00:46:57,170
having to run my application over

819
00:46:57,017 --> 00:47:00,098
as a fantastic time saver alright

820
00:47:00,098 --> 00:47:03,154
a so pictures are worth a thousand words
I feel that

821
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:09,123
demos are worth a thousand pictures

822
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:13,701
you know I'm gonna I'm getting a step on
Kevin's toes just a little bit here

823
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:18,554
the this custom front ASSOCHAM I am i
how a story but he's been working on

824
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:22,370
Anna you know this looks fantastic he's
done such an awesome job

825
00:47:22,037 --> 00:47:26,058
but the that thing is this is a vacation
happened to make no make it a little bit

826
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:27,297
more fun and vacationing

827
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:31,865
mean we just need a custom fun now I've
actually snuck a font and his project

828
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:33,960
here so I'm gonna go all right over

829
00:47:33,096 --> 00:47:37,118
to the front picker and you'll see that
shows right up in here in Interface

830
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:38,067
Builder

831
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:41,089
and I can pick my fun to show for it up
and it looks a little smaller than was

832
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:42,118
expected to Megan

833
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:46,044
bump up the size diesel bitter 236 that
looks pretty good

834
00:47:46,044 --> 00:47:53,044
and I could do the same thing here for
my sub subtitle my level

835
00:47:53,058 --> 00:47:56,127
bumper set up to point looks pretty good
okay and now since those

836
00:47:57,027 --> 00:48:01,085
the Fonterra just a little bit different
metrics I can adjust to update those

837
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:02,085
frames

838
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:05,142
okay South fantastic night can see right
on the campus what's gonna look like at

839
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:06,110
runtime

840
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:10,022
I've got information available to me and
gonna save a lot of time

841
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:13,079
when you're designing your I was
applications alright so now I'm gonna

842
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:14,087
jump over to

843
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:17,226
what I've been working on well kevin was
on stage I was working on the a

844
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:21,014
the Mac version of this is a pretty
quick workers South try catch up with

845
00:48:21,509 --> 00:48:21,567
and is that

846
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:25,790
i've kind ever copied from his work here
you can see we've got a very similarly a

847
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:25,173
and 10 notices

848
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:29,077
I'm using West End storyboards which is
a new feature

849
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:32,146
you know if any of your family and if
you're familiar story boards will be

850
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:36,075
immediately comfortable to you we're
building up our interface

851
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:41,020
using scenes connected with segways and
we're showing our organization directly

852
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:41,087
here on campus

853
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:44,286
all the connections between them and how
my applications going to flow and this

854
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:46,790
can be incredibly convenient way

855
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,084
to a to see I have British works you
notice that my main menu is actually

856
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:53,087
still present here and I can edit that
just as I would

857
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:57,108
in files so all those YouTube you can
actually do your entire application on

858
00:48:58,008 --> 00:49:00,041
it with an analyst in storyboard

859
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:03,139
so in addition to just being familiar to
I West developers

860
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:06,868
there's some great features within
storyboards that actually make your life

861
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:08,750
a lot easier you Mac developers

862
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:11,093
for example presenting a popover where
she

863
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:14,135
can be rather difficult when you have to
write code to get it to start an end

864
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,036
and this is a this is just a simple
screening a Segway

865
00:49:18,045 --> 00:49:21,091
to present a popover you have seen the
has your view and while I it's right

866
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:21,133
there

867
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:26,060
and sending is is really fast media in
addition managing parents would use

868
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:30,029
here in fact we have a split view
controller now NS but you controller

869
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:33,552
and Aftab you control are also new in
your semi and you can use those

870
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:38,460
in either Sims or storyboards so I've
configured a split you control here with

871
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:39,071
to split the items

872
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,077
with my I'm with my master in my detail
summers as what I would do

873
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:47,086
iPad and you can see I can use the same
type of things here I've got in fact in

874
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,890
an official affects the dow bottom

875
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:54,154
anna & and it just works let me show you
run this application

876
00:49:55,054 --> 00:50:00,115
on Mac using storyboards

877
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:05,046
okay so here's my application I've got a
nice looking source list in a

878
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:08,058
and I can click between them I got my
photos come in trading at the bottom

879
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:11,062
I've come a captions and it I've done it
with storyboards

880
00:50:11,062 --> 00:50:14,088
I can see all in one place and it's
incredibly convenient so I hope you guys

881
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:15,088
will check this out

882
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:18,133
as you're working on yosemite in higher
the this can be deployed only tea or

883
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:19,962
something about

884
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:23,560
but they're fantastic way for new
application development to speed up your

885
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:26,123
development all right next wanna talk to
you

886
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,116
a little bit about gesture recognizers
you probably also familiar with these

887
00:50:30,016 --> 00:50:31,021
from my OS

888
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:34,085
now in in Yosemite we've added five
gesture recognizers and have support for

889
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:34,110
them

890
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:38,089
Interface Builder as well so let's say
that I want to added just recognize our

891
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:41,248
filter object library you can see these
five the pop-up

892
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:45,060
I'm assay I want to go ahead and

893
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:48,245
put in a magnification gesture
recognizer wanna do some sort of pinch

894
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:48,391
to zoom

895
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:52,680
kind of action so it's a simple is
dragging from object library onto the

896
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:52,119
view

897
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:56,045
where you want to recognize the events
drop it right there you'll see it

898
00:50:56,045 --> 00:50:58,113
appears in my document outlined here on
the left

899
00:50:59,013 --> 00:51:02,932
and now all I have to do is connected up
to the source code so I have my

900
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:06,130
my view control here I mean option click
on my

901
00:51:06,013 --> 00:51:10,682
site view controller to open it in a
split and the cloth

902
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:15,170
was this area for now I cannot use the
connector source feature

903
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:19,816
with in Interface Builder I can control
click and drag from my magnification

904
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:21,170
gesture recognizer

905
00:51:21,017 --> 00:51:25,166
directly into my source code and have a
credit and outlet in action for me

906
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:29,060
in this case I want create an action
method that my gesture recognizer will

907
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:29,085
invoke

908
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:32,113
when events happened something select
action Anna

909
00:51:33,013 --> 00:51:38,027
treble clef elections fun name sometimes
I'm in a car this big if I

910
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:41,063
and some mystique and excitement to the
code as a now you can see I've got this

911
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:41,121
yr

912
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:45,119
this connection right here to the action
method right from I just written as and

913
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,048
when I run this

914
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:50,227
this message going to be invoked and and
the code that are right here

915
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:54,350
what will be fired without me having to
do any event detection myself

916
00:51:54,035 --> 00:51:57,129
it's a fantastically convenient way to
develop applications

917
00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:01,052
okay you know I'm Rd kinda starting to
regret the choice

918
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:04,108
for that selection in big if I it's a a
human-like

919
00:52:05,008 --> 00:52:08,187
my a coworker comes back to make it look
at how happy he is they're on vacation

920
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:09,292
where the beez

921
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:12,633
and he is trying to be too pleased to
find a name like big if I so

922
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:17,430
to reuse the new finding replace feature
nominees Command Option shift af

923
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:20,121
to make my find that a gator in find a
replacement

924
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:25,030
so I'm gonna get that horrible selecting
the man he ran a search for big if I

925
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:30,223
and something more reasonable examines I
hit return you'll see that detects now

926
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:34,020
in instances that selector both in my
source code enemy Interface Builder

927
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:34,991
documents

928
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:41,050
the fantastic time soon

929
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:43,056
Aikens I can select both these instances

930
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:47,105
replace them RC snapshot is trying to
get on my photo application here

931
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:51,070
want to take a picture to so we're gonna
we're going to just replace and you can

932
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:51,052
see

933
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:55,084
I've got a zoom right here for my
magnification gesture recognizer

934
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:58,183
the action has been a place to zoom I
don't have to destroy my connection

935
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:02,145
change my selector name and recreate on
this connection for MACO into so

936
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:06,136
it's a fantastic time saver fact for
fine replace in fact

937
00:53:07,036 --> 00:53:10,043
fireplace also works with in document
find

938
00:53:11,006 --> 00:53:15,014
so with command F I can bring up right
inside of my doctrine here and I can

939
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:17,173
search for all sorts of things you can
find strings that it would appear in

940
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:18,131
text

941
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:23,120
if I look for label I can find those as
well and a little highlight for me

942
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:27,043
where it may appear to select a name
where it may appear in text in a string

943
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:30,147
and so on on for example us look for it
another thing that you can use

944
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:35,144
fine for unexpectedly convene is to jump
between parts of your view if you like

945
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:39,047
so for example I have my site you
control and I have a list you can the

946
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:40,052
second type list

947
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:43,058
and going to show me here's my site list
table view controller

948
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:46,059
this can be incredibly handy we have a
large storyboard and you have your

949
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:47,113
scenes named appropriately

950
00:53:48,013 --> 00:53:51,027
you can jump between them with with find
right in the document

951
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:55,069
so this is a a fantastic time shippers
well the last thing but I'd like to

952
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:55,167
demonstrate for you

953
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:59,075
is a little bit how Interface Builder
participates in your

954
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:03,099
localization workflow to help improve
that Simon open my

955
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:06,164
assistant editor again and I'm gonna
close made to the area

956
00:54:07,064 --> 00:54:11,130
now I want to bring up my preview and
you'll see them I selected few shows up

957
00:54:12,003 --> 00:54:12,091
in the preview

958
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:16,018
on the right side now if I have

959
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:19,070
it if I have localizations already I can
use this to preview

960
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,100
Kevin I have only been working on this
for for a little bit but we're pretty

961
00:54:22,063 --> 00:54:24,114
sure this app is gonna take off
worldwide and we have all sorts of

962
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:25,095
localizations

963
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,136
for now all we have is English but even
when you don't have any translations

964
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:33,098
you see this entry in there double
length sooner language so I can test

965
00:54:33,098 --> 00:54:34,101
this and see

966
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:38,009
how is my user interface going to react
are my I don't have constraints and

967
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:39,094
correctly to help those

968
00:54:39,094 --> 00:54:42,098
those views you can clap you have a
fantastic

969
00:54:42,098 --> 00:54:46,170
I can see without running my application

970
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:51,021
how my interface is going to react and i
cant I can see that as I select from the

971
00:54:51,084 --> 00:54:53,138
review all my strings will be double
then I can easily see that

972
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:57,120
once you have translations you can
easily plug dozen as well

973
00:54:58,002 --> 00:55:01,098
a new contest those in Interface Builder
at design-time which is a fantastic time

974
00:55:02,016 --> 00:55:02,060
saver

975
00:55:02,006 --> 00:55:06,074
alright so you've seen some

976
00:55:07,028 --> 00:55:10,035
the great new features that we've been
working hard to bring to you this year

977
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,186
Interface Builder next good sex again
revisiting the three big themes

978
00:55:14,086 --> 00:55:19,088
first is live NIS that more your view
spend your content and your application

979
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:23,081
are live in the IB design campus than
ever before

980
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:26,084
there's more power for you 3 quickly and
avoid

981
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:31,019
thus the costly build and run in debug
lips seconds adaptability

982
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:35,100
and greater dynamism being able to adapt
to change and configuration where your

983
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,098
view can appear

984
00:55:36,098 --> 00:55:39,164
and third is power in parity great new
features

985
00:55:40,064 --> 00:55:43,146
in the West End and I O S and within
Interface Builder itself help you work

986
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:45,094
more quickly and efficiently

987
00:55:45,094 --> 00:55:49,113
than ever before any questions you have
should be directed towards will prevent

988
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,032
or Steve them on

989
00:55:51,032 --> 00:55:54,119
with great documentation online
available there are quite a few related

990
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:55,082
sessions

991
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:58,125
they'll be fantastic for deeper dives in
the subject matter you can catch on

992
00:55:59,025 --> 00:55:59,030
video

993
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:01,092
thank you so much enjoy the rest the
conference
