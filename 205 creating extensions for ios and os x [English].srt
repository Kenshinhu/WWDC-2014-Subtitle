1
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,410
hello

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,810
I'm Ian Baird I was frameworks engineer

3
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,300
and today I'm here to tell you about
creating extensions

4
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:33,044
for Iowa's and OS 10 gonna lay out a
quick agenda for today stock

5
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,114
first we're going to talk about
extensions an extension points

6
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:40,703
then I'm going to invite my colleague
Matt Campbell

7
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,870
from the Notification Center team to the
stage to tell you more

8
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:49,096
and show you more about creating one of
the hottest new tickets at BBC 14

9
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:54,105
today extensions

10
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:58,089
and then following on from that we're
going to invite

11
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,098
our colleague I for 10 onto the stage

12
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:04,107
to tell you more about how to create
share extensions

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,070
like the one you saw in the keynote with
Pinterest

14
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,088
moving along

15
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:14,164
water extensions well extensions

16
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:18,142
are almost like it's a way for you

17
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:23,113
to extend the system and other
applications

18
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:27,031
it's almost like more surface area for
you to be able to apply

19
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,078
bits and pieces have your app as you can
see here

20
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,086
we have a screenshot at the Apple
homepage on an iPad

21
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:37,060
showing the new activity view controller

22
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:40,092
you'll notice a lot of familiar faces a
lot of familiar icons

23
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:44,071
in that activity view controller you can
see messages male

24
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,075
and we have a new one the butterfly

25
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,120
and butterflies sharing extension you
can see it at home

26
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:54,040
right there with his brother in right in
the midst

27
00:01:54,058 --> 00:02:00,074
at the sharing extensions and we also
support sharing extensions on LSN

28
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:03,115
in see we have the butterfly sherry
extension on Yosemite

29
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:08,022
we support Notification Center
extensions

30
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,094
also known as today extensions and as
you can see

31
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:15,654
notification extensions are really good
forgiving you

32
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:19,401
at a glance information something where
you just wanna pull your phone

33
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:23,920
out your pocket take a quick look checks
in sports scores

34
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:26,187
may be traffic conditions the weather
and put it back in your pocket

35
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:31,128
gives you at a glance quick access to
information you want

36
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:35,079
and of course we support this on your
seventy

37
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,085
and you can see it looks gorgeous
blended right over that new background

38
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:42,224
it's just beautiful stunningly beautiful
team did a great job

39
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,020
next

40
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,500
I want to show you the custom action
extensions you can see here

41
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:53,010
we have our new annotate image extension
which I'm gonna show you how to build

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,063
tomorrow

43
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:57,125
right in that role with actions actions
can be

44
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:01,118
you I in nine you I actions that he saw
with the Bing translate extension

45
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:06,076
and we support custom actions on the
west end as well as a matter fact this

46
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:06,395
is

47
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,570
the infrastructure for the markup
extension

48
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,109
on a West can you'll notice is a very
common theme

49
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,026
were sharing infrastructure we're making
it easy for you to build things for both

50
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:18,119
platforms

51
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,101
next on Iowa s only

52
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:26,047
we have the I the photo extensions now

53
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:29,110
if there's a photo filter that you've
been messing I don't know

54
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,038
maybe on or an annotation

55
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,113
extension you would like to make for
photos you can build it now

56
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:42,110
right into the photos you why this is
really cool and we also support

57
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,013
document providers document providers
bring

58
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:50,079
storage and things like that from the
cloud writing and applications

59
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,838
inside a via West this is a first it
really breaks down a lot of barriers

60
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,558
that we've all been living with for

61
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,639
I believe 7 releases and next I want to
tell you about a finder extensions

62
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:06,837
finder extensions are really cool in the
past if you wanted to be able to bad

63
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:07,750
sure

64
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:10,091
annotate items and folders inside the
Finder

65
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:13,130
you may have to resort to super sketchy
behavior

66
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,018
like mocking jacked or or some sort of
hackery

67
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,705
and now you don't have to do that now
you actually have a supported way

68
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,660
to daj items in the Finder and we think
this is really cool

69
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:28,325
and then

70
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,970
the last but not least third-party
keyboards

71
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:34,606
were supporting third-party keyboards in
I'll ask now

72
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,330
using extensions so I told you about
extensions and some the extension point

73
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,122
so we're offering

74
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:48,520
NIOS and a West and next I'd like to
tell you about delivering extensions

75
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:51,055
extensions are delivered as part of your
up known as

76
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,431
the extension container an extension
container

77
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,630
petain many different types extensions

78
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:01,111
for example it could contain today view
which it

79
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:06,320
it contain sharing extension and it
could also contain

80
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,441
maybe multiple custom action extensions

81
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,740
they're all bound up with in your
applications bundle

82
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:16,078
and delivered via the App Store

83
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:20,084
extension points wife talked a little
bit look down extension points earlier

84
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:23,126
well tell tell you what they are
extension points again are the new

85
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:27,082
bits and pieces have surface area that
we've exposed on the system

86
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:30,116
for your extensions to buy into for
example

87
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:34,083
a today view which it binds to the
Notification Center

88
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,110
via the Notification Center extension 30
today view

89
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:41,038
extension point this means you're never
going to see

90
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:46,123
I today view extension in the activity
view controller for example

91
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:50,105
and one thing to remember about all
extensions is that their purpose

92
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:54,071
build binaries see these are not aP's
these are not even

93
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:58,076
at apiece if you're out it's not a
special mode that we launcher app and

94
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:02,022
it's a special purpose binary houses own

95
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:05,036
code signature has its own set of
entitlements

96
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:09,045
and it has own container Damien's going
to speak to this further in tomorrow's

97
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:10,136
session

98
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:14,047
so as i sat there not outs and they're
always

99
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:18,105
accessed via Apple frameworks code you
never really direct we launched an apple

100
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,012
frameworks code

101
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,079
is in charge of discovering them for you
and providing usually the user

102
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,100
interaction by which their launch in all
talk about that later

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,077
and as I was talking with the developer
at lunch about this right before we came

104
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,161
here these are not facilitating

105
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,085
app to app my PC you don't get like

106
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:40,147
a pipe back to the containing out for
your extension be able to talk to it

107
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:45,054
if you want to build workflows that
incorporate apk app by PC you can still

108
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,055
use things like

109
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:49,110
UI application open /url but

110
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:53,095
what I would ask you to do is reconsider
some these workflows that you had before

111
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,029
that involved

112
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:58,125
sort of contextually switching from one
application to another on a user's phone

113
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:02,121
and reconsider casting this may be in
terms of custom actions which are really

114
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,057
the spiritual successors to you services

115
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:11,066
so next what our extension points a very
high level they mark extensible parts

116
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,106
for the system

117
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:17,088
they're always packaged in system
frameworks we don't support

118
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:20,093
third-party extension points and they
combine

119
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,045
API and policies you can imagine again
with the to debut aged

120
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:29,061
it to debut widget its it's very simple
it's largely is Matt's going to tell you

121
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:32,125
a view controller but this view
controller also comes with its own

122
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,040
policy

123
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:37,071
policy which incorporates things like
launch characteristics

124
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:42,053
an important thing to remember about
extensions most extensions on the system

125
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:45,082
are bound 121 with our hosting out

126
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:49,111
so let me give you an example of this
what say you write a sharing extension

127
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,045
and the sharing extension is invoked in
Safari

128
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:56,129
instanceof your extension a new process
is going to be spun up

129
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,054
to serve Safari now the user homes out

130
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:03,066
goes over to mail and large is your
extension again

131
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:07,157
but say maybe to share an attachment a
brand new process is going to be spun up

132
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:12,376
four-year extension those processes are
not going to share address spaces

133
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,210
this protects you from mistakes your
code if you're still using Objective C

134
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,070
in you have a while pointer something
like that

135
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:21,011
you're not going to be able to bring
down all the instances have your

136
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:21,165
extension

137
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:26,102
that are running on the system it's
really cool

138
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:30,066
the extension point also governs the
presentation have your extension

139
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:33,545
important thing to remember is that you
extensions are you I view controllers

140
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,223
you can hear this multiple times today

141
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,760
but you are you controllers can be
expose the user in multiple ways

142
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:43,275
and usually since extensions live inside
the applique inside the user interface

143
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,058
another application

144
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:50,007
its up to that application up to the
system as to how it decides present you

145
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,541
you can either be contained or presented
Notification Center

146
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,010
widgets to debut extensions are
contained

147
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:02,070
while sharing extensions are presented

148
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,130
and many extension points support for a
few extension point support

149
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:10,018
view controller and non view controller
variance at the extension point

150
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:13,063
for instance custom actions as you'll
see tomorrow

151
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:17,012
support a view controller variant which
allows the user to interact with the

152
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:20,910
content before it's transformed and sent
back to the host

153
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:23,169
as you saw during the keynote when Craig
tapped the Bing translate extension

154
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:27,156
there was no UI and that was in non-fuel
extension and we'll tell you more about

155
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:30,835
that later

156
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,740
cell how extensions and felt this is
again

157
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,077
going back to our example the show you
what happens

158
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,145
when user decides to tap on the
butterfly sharing extension

159
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:45,144
user taps and the extension host which
is safari at this time

160
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,106
goes and talks to the Notification
Center framework

161
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,025
the notification sorry not notification
the social framework

162
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,112
and the social framework goes and
discovers and loads and presents the

163
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,016
extension

164
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:01,069
you'll notice that Safari is not
directly

165
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:05,073
watching the extension at any point its
balancing through Apple frameworks to do

166
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:06,140
this

167
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:12,007
so in summary extensions are small
pieces the functionality

168
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:16,071
their purpose built to do one thing and
get out the way

169
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:19,450
they stand system in New an interesting
ways

170
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,110
we can't wait to see what you guys do
with these things

171
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:28,014
and a mark extendable parse the system
as I said new surface area for you to

172
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,137
attach the functionality of your app

173
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:33,098
interesting and meaningful ways for our
users

174
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:36,107
and now to tell you more about
Notification Center extensions

175
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:44,007
I'd like to invite my colleague not
gamble to the stage

176
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:49,122
hello I'm at Campbell Newman engineer in
the

177
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:54,031
I US notifications team and today I'm
gonna tell you about Notification Center

178
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:54,860
extensions

179
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,164
widgets as we call them now we've had
widgets in some fashion on the

180
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,434
system for a while now but for the first
time

181
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,860
you know I was 8 we're giving developers
the power to add their own content to

182
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:08,147
the notification centers todavia

183
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:13,716
now perhaps most fundamentally

184
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,144
we did serve you controllers so that
means everything you know about you

185
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,677
controllers including

186
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,026
the life cycle in containment behavior
in API will serve you well when you're

187
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,100
constructing your widget

188
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,240
for example the appearance calls he'll
tell you when

189
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:31,056
your widget is coming and going in the
Notification Center

190
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:35,091
in a particular interest is you will
appear as you want to be sure that your

191
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:35,157
view is

192
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:39,626
up and ready to be used by the user by
the time you're returning from you will

193
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:40,790
appear

194
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,938
so speedy have getting ready it's
important to get ready fast performance

195
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,940
the very big consideration with
notification center widgets

196
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:53,293
so couple tips are be sure to load cache
data so you're bringing up your view

197
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:55,184
quickly and ready to go

198
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,990
and if you have some new data comes in
you can do your own custom transition

199
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:03,948
also kick off your expensive operations
as early as possible

200
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,560
and definitely in the background and
when those expensive operations return

201
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:15,063
be sure to catch this data so layout is
another concern

202
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:19,322
are of course your widgets in your your
widget has control over its

203
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,915
subdue hierarchy in laying all your
content out but just as with any other

204
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,350
parent child

205
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,094
you control your relationship the
Notification Center will be laying out

206
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:32,102
your views frame so that means that the
notification center is setting

207
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:36,353
the frames you don't set your own widget
use frame

208
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,110
but of course not all content is created
equal

209
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:43,050
so if you might have need some more room

210
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:46,034
for your content you can indicate your
preferred height

211
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,142
you do this in two ways the for sister
on a layup

212
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,271
if you can are described your Widgets

213
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,620
height with constraints then those to be
honored automatically in Notification

214
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:58,110
Center

215
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:04,300
otherwise abusing more manual layout you
can use the view controller method Sep

216
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,750
referred content size

217
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,594
and both at the systems work across both
I O S

218
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,325
and OS 10 so while you

219
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,878
will definitely want to set your size as
early as possible to ensure that you're

220
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,344
showing your content

221
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:22,810
are him the right way in Notification
Center that's not the only time

222
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:26,480
that you can call it if for some reason
you are showing different content or

223
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,000
changes you can call this later

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,769
for instance let's say that we had a
button that would show a little bit more

225
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:33,680
content

226
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:36,407
are a little bit more detail about some
content that we have in our widget

227
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,890
you could tie this up to this action
calculate the new height for this new

228
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,136
content and then just call separate for
content size

229
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:48,060
the Notification Center will take care
of this it'll automatically resize your

230
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:48,485
widget

231
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,470
but that's only half the story which you
probably want to do is ensure

232
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:56,085
that your content enemies along with
this transition

233
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,014
and you can do that on I Wes with the
new method

234
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,834
view will transition to size with
transition coordinator

235
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:07,385
so if you're would implement this method
it'll get called

236
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,920
and pass in a transition coordinator and
with this corner you can call

237
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,218
enemy alongside transition passing in
your

238
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:20,110
a block with your animations and easily
run in parallel with the system's

239
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,020
resize animation and again and then a
completion to know when everything's

240
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,060
finished up

241
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,380
now there's a similar story on OS 10

242
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:31,237
in this case its view will transition to
size

243
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,592
again this will be call and you can take
advantage love

244
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,783
and as animation contact to run your own
animation group

245
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,482
and again pass in a completion handler
see you know when everything's finished

246
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,000
up

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,056
now new IRS 8 is a protocol

248
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:50,275
NC widget providing and one of the I

249
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,620
of film at business protocol is would
you perform update

250
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:57,091
with completion handler and some porn
implement this one

251
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,880
as it'll insurer that your which is
content stays up-to-date

252
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:05,092
so if this is implemented you'll be
passing completion handler

253
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:09,116
you want to perform your own update and
then determine what is the appropriate

254
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:13,017
result to pass back in that block

255
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:16,102
so if you have some new data go ahead
and use NC update result

256
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:20,931
new data if there's nothing new

257
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:24,951
go ahead news no data and if something
went horribly wrong

258
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,241
pass failed in will try to leave well
enough alone

259
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:32,610
and then finally be sure to call the
completion handler with the result

260
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:35,149
I that you have

261
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:40,097
alright let's take a look at this

262
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:45,076
so so you may remember from last year I
we had a presentation we showed off

263
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:50,012
and awesome I O S application for
staying in touch with all the clowns

264
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,110
better in your clown network call that
clown town

265
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:57,104
what we're gonna take this application a
little bit further by adding widgets

266
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:01,143
for the Notification Center

267
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:04,214
now adding a widget is as simple as
opening up an existing application

268
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:06,541
project

269
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,170
and adding any target for both iowa's

270
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:13,110
and OS 10 you'll see there's an
application extension section

271
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:17,052
and you can just select the today
extension

272
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,350
but I've actually already started work
on one sarin ago

273
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:23,912
right into our view controller here

274
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,097
switch its our view controllers and the
first thing I'm gonna do

275
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:31,040
is ensure that my which it has the right
height

276
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:36,098
so I'm using an interface builder
storyboard for my interface

277
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:39,099
so away from near is a pretty handy
place

278
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,166
to take care of this sector calling
super and then

279
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:48,071
setting up a little state I'm gonna go
ahead and get the most recent Posts

280
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:52,375
once I've gotten those update my table
view

281
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,563
I'm this doesn't need to be animator
just initializing here

282
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,970
an important step is making sure to set
my preferred content sized

283
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:04,104
to this case just the content size at my
table view

284
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:07,424
so this'll make sure that were
initialized in the state were showing

285
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,100
a single post in our widget which is
nice

286
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:14,300
but perhaps you want to see a little bit
more of what's going on in your client

287
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,520
network

288
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:18,064
while how bout we add a button

289
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:22,149
an action for Ubuntu show a little bit
more

290
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,388
so the first thing will do is update our
state

291
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,470
and then calculate our preferred height
which the three using a table view one

292
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:30,120
account the number

293
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:35,067
rose and also make sure to account for
our full review

294
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:40,544
once we have our preferred height we
want to set are preferred content size

295
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,520
and then make sure we tell ourselves
that we had to do an update

296
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:47,060
in the future that'll come in handy
later

297
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:52,083
so again we've set our preferred content
size so this will be sure to animate the

298
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,088
widget to the appropriate Hyatt

299
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:58,017
but we want to make sure that our
content comes in a really nice animated

300
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,470
fashion

301
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,122
and to do that will implement view will
transition to size

302
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:09,087
with transition coordinator and so if we
have a coordinator

303
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:12,184
then we know that this is an animated
transition and so will call animate

304
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:16,178
alongside transition completion

305
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:21,094
to make sure to update our table view an
animated fashion

306
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:24,109
and in the completion be sure I

307
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,098
to update the title of our button up

308
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:31,216
if for some reason we didn't get a
coordinator then we'll just

309
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,500
up dinner table without animation and
then update the button

310
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,018
so this will make sure that our I art

311
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:43,097
adding a bar rose comes in a nice
animated way alongside the system

312
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:45,159
animation that's resizing are widget

313
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:51,144
now one more thing I want to do before
we give this a try

314
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:55,107
that is making sure that our content
stays up-to-date so I'm an implement the

315
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:56,052
method

316
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,151
widget perform update with completion
handler

317
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:03,095
so I'll start by getting the recent most
recent Posts make sure it get any

318
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:04,157
updates

319
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:09,656
and then calculate the result so if we
already know that we needed to do an

320
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:10,970
update

321
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:14,133
or if we actually did get some new
content they want to use NC update

322
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,099
result new data

323
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:21,258
otherwise we can just go ahead and use
no data

324
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,480
so if we actually did get to new data

325
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:28,120
wanna do a couple things will def want
to update our table view to ensure that

326
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,003
it's reflecting our most recent content

327
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:37,094
and then up their preferred size to
ensure there which is the right height

328
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:41,073
and in either case we certainly don't
need any more updates

329
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,540
and will call our completion handler
with our result

330
00:19:45,054 --> 00:19:48,125
alright I think we can go ahead and give
this a shot

331
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:54,674
so I'm gonna go ahead and build and run
for the simulator

332
00:19:54,899 --> 00:20:01,899
now switch over to the simulator no

333
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:05,095
ok and here we have our client an
application

334
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:10,147
on a home out of this and present the
Notification Center

335
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:16,086
go to the Edit menu and our which it is
not there

336
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:19,174
the I actual on

337
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:26,493
to give that one more shot

338
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,184
well yes there we go

339
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:36,950
there's our application

340
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:41,151
bring down as one new is it available
there it is

341
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:46,098
for

342
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:50,277
alright so hit done and here's our
widget

343
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,370
now we can see that Corbin icon has a
multi-colored suspenders is giving away

344
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:59,042
gonna make sure to take care alright his
arm or bun

345
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:02,159
we tap that get a new rose animate in
nicely

346
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,103
y la to weddings happening

347
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:11,004
less class is everything back down and
nice animated fashion

348
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:14,009
is looking pretty good well i def wanna
know more about these multi-colored

349
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:16,127
suspender somebody go ahead and

350
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:20,100
ha ok I what we've definitely seen

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,929
if you look at the the system widgets
that's a pretty common pattern to

352
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,974
tap something in the widget and then
transition to the application and maybe

353
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:32,820
I see some more details or get some more
contact are well that's definitely

354
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,174
something that we're interested in doing

355
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:39,463
so let's return Xcode miss stopped at a
Burger

356
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:44,540
and since I'm using a table view I want
to implement able to you

357
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,573
dislike throw it in XPath

358
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,120
so after we make sure we have a valid
post

359
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:54,720
ability to manage have an object called
the extension context

360
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:57,137
now the extension contest is an object
it you'll have access to you in your

361
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:58,044
widget

362
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:02,022
are in any extension that's running in
host

363
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:05,037
and it has a tell you some interesting
things about what's happening

364
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:09,076
in your current host I'd also has a
couple really interesting methods

365
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:13,540
in our case really take advantage of
open URL completion handler

366
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:16,056
now I have to find a custom URL scheme
that share between my widget my

367
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,079
application

368
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,098
so i cant construct the URL with this
scheme

369
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:26,040
and then add some identifying
information for my post

370
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:29,863
and then one final thing I want to do
just make sure that the Select this row

371
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:34,040
so it's not selected the next time the
user pose down notification center

372
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:40,008
alright sort build and run this again

373
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:45,082
here's our application present here

374
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:48,571
at this back

375
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,210
and here's Corbin again so let's see if
I tap this hopefully I'll be able to get

376
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,220
some more information about the
suspenders

377
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:58,474
their ego brings us right the
application gets more detail make sure

378
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:06,059
we don't miss out on the suspenders

379
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:14,124
so few things to remember we deserve you
controllers

380
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:18,025
everything you know about view
controllers in the API and behaviors to

381
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:19,052
serve you really well

382
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:23,103
when you're constructing a rigid

383
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,070
also be sure your Widgets resume
immediately you don't want users bring

384
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:31,426
down notification center in tapping in
not having anything happen

385
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,740
now while the notification center
handles layout not all widgets are

386
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:36,173
created equal you want different heights

387
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:40,272
you can do this with the preferred
height

388
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:45,010
within the constraints in auto layout or
explicitly through preferred content

389
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:45,650
size

390
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:50,661
missus across both platforms also you
want to be sure to you if you into your

391
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,700
cart along with the resize animation

392
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:55,045
this again we have API's on both I O S
and OS 10

393
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:59,059
help you do this

394
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:02,070
and then be sure to handle update
request to make sure that all the

395
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,015
content what's up today

396
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:13,005
now I'd like to invite guy up on stage
to tell us about share extensions

397
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:17,075
hi so my name is guy Fullerton

398
00:24:17,075 --> 00:24:20,121
and I am an engineer on the IRS social
an account teams

399
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:23,074
and I'm gonna give you everything you
need to know to implement share

400
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:23,141
extensions

401
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,098
so sure extensions

402
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,109
our way to take sharing and upload
functionality

403
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,015
in your app and package it up and did
that presented in the sharing mood

404
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,038
standard activity and sharing
affordances in the operating system

405
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:39,127
shirts go back

406
00:24:40,027 --> 00:24:44,034
so like the US activity view and share
menu in Mac OS 10

407
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:47,071
so this is particularly useful

408
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:50,077
for Social Network aP's or perhaps that
like to do video

409
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,115
or photo hosting for example a lot of
other stuff so

410
00:24:57,015 --> 00:25:01,020
able to come a concrete example but they
have got a photo blogging application

411
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:03,020
that normally allows major to launch the
app

412
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,047
pick a photo from the photos library
i'ma take that a little bit maybe make

413
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:11,066
a choose an audience to present it to
you and then upload it to a photoblog

414
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:14,139
but wouldn't it be great if I could do
that upload directly from within Photos

415
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,074
app

416
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:19,089
well that's what share extension would
let you do so let's aim I mean photos

417
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:22,096
I select the photo that I like

418
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:25,169
tap the share button pops the activity
view

419
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:30,072
and you can see my phone about look
photo blog application icon there any

420
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:30,186
activity view

421
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:35,090
tap that and up slides a compose cheaper
for a blog

422
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:38,086
let your user type some text to
annotated choose an audience whether

423
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,073
they want to limit the

424
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:46,135
exposure that for and what not and
posted some going to hammer this home a

425
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,049
lot in the next couple days

426
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:51,086
but a lot of extensions are basically
just view controllers that's where most

427
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:53,163
of the workers and you probably aren't
familiar with how to do that

428
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:57,105
but share extensions have a couple other
concerns having to do with their

429
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:58,070
packaging

430
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:01,073
specifically the extensions in populist
so let's talk about that

431
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:05,129
so normally

432
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:09,033
when a share extension shows up in one
of these sharing affordances

433
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,136
you generally want that extension to
have been absent name

434
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,114
that's going to be the thing the
musician was for mayor from with looking

435
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:17,109
for when they want to select an
extension

436
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,095
but some applications may have multiple
share affordances

437
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:25,129
I the photo blog for example might want
a basic posting share functionality

438
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:29,114
and maybe once a way to specifically set
the blogs header photo for example

439
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:34,042
so it's important to be able to
customize your share extensions name

440
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:37,086
and what you do that is with CF Michael
display name

441
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:40,144
in your info pls just said that to the
name you want your share extension to

442
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:41,113
show up with

443
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:45,056
and sharing you I will display the name
appropriately for your extension

444
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:50,059
so the next thing to talk about

445
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:54,132
or activation rules and this is probably
best explain to an example

446
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:59,061
let's say you're in photos and you have
a set a trio of things

447
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:03,136
selected you get two photos and a video
and user wants to share that

448
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,059
so they tap the share button a pops the

449
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,108
are you actively view where the share
menu 10 X 10 and

450
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:14,027
behind-the-scenes we've created an
extension context

451
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:18,051
net extension context is the conduit
that your extension we used the poll

452
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:18,112
data

453
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,079
from the host application into itself so
this extension context for this

454
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,092
particular scenario

455
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:26,101
has three things I'm a reference to two
of those images

456
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:31,017
and of course a reference to the video
as well now the user might have a bunch

457
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,090
of share extensions on their system

458
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:35,034
and each them wants to get involved in
different kinda situations

459
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:39,058
and so the activation rules are with
that lets the system make the right

460
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,155
decision about which extensions to put
in the activity beware the share menu

461
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:50,055
based on the kind of data that any
extension context their two ways

462
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:54,090
for your extension to supply its
activation horse the first as a

463
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:54,064
predicate

464
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:59,103
now every extensions in populist has an
NS extension dictionary

465
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:03,015
and within that and its extension
dictionary is the NS extension

466
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:03,090
attributes

467
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:06,105
the system uses those attributes as part
of its decision-making process about

468
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,129
which extensions to show

469
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:12,120
but importantly for sharing stanchions
the end its activation rule

470
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:16,075
I'll with in the NSX pension actuaries
is what you need to set

471
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:20,155
if you set that to a string that the
predicate we will run that predicate in

472
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:24,107
the host app and figure out if your
extension is appropriate and that

473
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,026
predicate can be as detailed as you need
it to be

474
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:30,029
were can be simple if you want to be
whatever you need to get the job done

475
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:35,105
and this will serve the needs of a lot
of extensions other extensions however

476
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:40,073
army have a little more fine-grained
what we found internally is that a lot

477
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:41,084
of our extensions

478
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:44,162
just wanted to know basically just
wanted to say that they support a basic

479
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:45,109
setup

480
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:49,052
images or videos or some URL's attacked

481
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:52,061
so we offer these condensed rules that
allow extensions to specify just those

482
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:55,130
particular things without having to
write a complex predicates

483
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:59,096
now ultimately these condensed rules
boil down to a predicate and behind the

484
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,091
scenes but you don't need it worry about
that

485
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:06,099
so to specify condense rules you still
put me in and its activation rule

486
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:07,181
insider and its extension attributes

487
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,175
but this time it's a dictionary and
there are a number of keys you can put

488
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,141
in a dictionary that indicate the amount
of that type of data

489
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:18,090
your extension is interested in

490
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:22,076
now the bottom those two activation
rules both had to do with web content

491
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:28,080
and they're slightly different we have a
web URL support and a webpage support

492
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:31,081
and i wanna go into the details about
these so some

493
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:35,131
share extensions are all about taking
the link you're currently looking at in

494
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:36,100
Safari

495
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,032
and posting it someplace else to some
vetoes somebody else can click on that

496
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:41,113
link and go see the web page

497
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,038
for those kinds of sharing extensions
you want to specify that you support the

498
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:45,133
web URL

499
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:50,119
max camp now another class assuring
extensions are all about looking at the

500
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,057
page that Safari is currently that
display

501
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,155
and polling data out on that page and
for those cheering extensions

502
00:29:57,055 --> 00:30:01,092
we have the web page with Max count
activation will

503
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,157
now in order to support the web page
with Max count your extension also needs

504
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:07,074
to supply a javascript that's run

505
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:10,152
to determine what part the web content
actually stick on the extension

506
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:14,061
contact I'm not gonna go into detail on
that here but in tomorrow's session we

507
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:21,084
dive into the tape detail on that so
please check that session a

508
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:25,120
hammering at home yet again extensions
are basically just view controllers

509
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:30,030
so it's a lot of familiar territory
share extensions can be implemented with

510
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,094
two kinds view controllers

511
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:34,126
on we support among both I O S and OS 10

512
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:41,074
and you can subclass you are you control
or an issue control as you wish

513
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:44,085
you probably already have you control
the code in your apt today that you can

514
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:45,139
repurpose per share extension

515
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,092
sure maybe you wanna make some tweaks to
it too to conform better to make it a

516
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:49,145
limited

517
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:53,139
I'm another space you have on the screen
or what not but you take that existing

518
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:54,105
code

519
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:58,044
massage it a little bit and deploy an
extension and you can get to look

520
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:00,092
exactly how you want using your own
branding

521
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,145
exist in your life whatever

522
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:08,090
some extensions however want to conform
to the standard system share should look

523
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:11,051
and for them we offer the SL compose
service you controller

524
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:15,040
that you can subclass to get among other
things the standard

525
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:18,010
book standard animations text editing

526
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,015
a indication the remaining characters
based on the characters type so far

527
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:26,078
I the post and Cancel buttons built in
previewing

528
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:30,146
and other limited matter customization

529
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:33,137
so once you implemented your view
controller the next thing you need to be

530
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:34,120
concerned about

531
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:39,070
is actually doing the upload or post to
wherever you're sharing stated

532
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:42,110
the key here is that you need to use an
issue oral session

533
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,079
with a background session configuration
reason being

534
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:49,102
your extension does not live beyond its
presentation

535
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:53,015
at least not very long and we'll talk
more about that tomorrow

536
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:56,052
so you need to make sure that by using a
background in this URL session

537
00:31:56,052 --> 00:32:00,123
you're allowing the system to handle the
upload for you

538
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:04,091
secret a background in a swirl session
configuration build an issue I'll

539
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,095
session around that

540
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:11,122
build an issue I'll URL request that
encompasses the items that are

541
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:16,101
being shared and create and upload task
wrapped around

542
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:21,022
an issue or a crest and then start that
up a task

543
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:25,022
once you've done that the system is
gonna handle the upload for you

544
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:28,050
at that point your extension needs to
tell the host ap

545
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:31,051
that it's done and you can tell down the
presentation a view controller

546
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:34,134
and you do that by calling a method on
the extension context called complete

547
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:41,068
request returning items completion
handler

548
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:44,159
if the user chooses to cancel your sheet
or whatever your presentation happens to

549
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:45,105
be

550
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,037
there's another extension context meant
that you need call has called cancel

551
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:49,096
request

552
00:32:49,096 --> 00:32:52,098
with your

553
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:56,139
so mad already talked about performance
with request with respect to the

554
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,055
today which is and i wanna talk about it
a little bit different way in terms of

555
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:01,071
share tensions

556
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:05,135
I'm sure extensions often have to grab a
bunch of data from the host at

557
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:09,036
they might be dealing with 10 photos for
an enormous video

558
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:12,056
and he can be expensive to be pulling
that from the host ap

559
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,080
while the presentation is happening so
if you notice

560
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,061
that I your your presentation mission is
staggering

561
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:22,070
you may need for someone that heavy
lifting until after the presentation is

562
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:24,032
completed

563
00:33:24,095 --> 00:33:27,170
if you subclass UAB controller an issue
controller do whatever makes sense for

564
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:28,986
the rest if your code

565
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,460
just two for that task so it's not
impacting the animation

566
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:36,048
if you subclass SL compose service be
controller however

567
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:39,144
we will call your subclasses
presentation animation did finish method

568
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:47,044
giving your I'm you control a good hook
with which to start the heavy lifting

569
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:52,041
so let's take a look at the photo blog
ap and a photoblog share extension

570
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:57,062
quick

571
00:33:57,062 --> 00:34:01,065
before going into the code I'm gonna
show you the

572
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:04,112
sure extension running so some legal
make a little bit more sense

573
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:08,050
so we're gonna go into photos just like
that for the screenshots I showed

574
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,052
pick a different one puppies

575
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:15,126
I'm and I will do just one so

576
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:19,645
no its not be that there we go

577
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,620
click on the photo blog sure extension
and up comes the composer you so this is

578
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,079
clearly using

579
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,155
the standard system composed she looked
arrive from são compose service we

580
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:28,128
controller

581
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:33,086
and you can do a couple different things
a you can type some text

582
00:34:33,086 --> 00:34:36,152
and as I'm typing text kinda hard to see
but there's a little indicator the

583
00:34:37,052 --> 00:34:40,129
remaining characters and once I type too
much text it goes negative

584
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:44,037
and the post button disables this is all
happening more or less for free all

585
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:47,024
season details when we look at the code

586
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:50,025
the image preview their it happens for
free

587
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:53,613
the base class will be there for you I
we also

588
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,330
this particular subclass adds an
audience picker

589
00:34:57,033 --> 00:35:00,035
so this photo blog supports the notion
of posting publicly

590
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:03,059
I or only to my friends were completely
primarily and you can

591
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:08,128
choose a different audience 3 some text
here so we're within

592
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:13,034
the allowed range and we can post so
let's go back in Xcode

593
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:17,122
and see how we implement that

594
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:21,028
so the first thing I did it's hard to
see sorry but this is skills they can be

595
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:24,091
with the hippie with the first thing I
did was set the panel display name for

596
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:24,180
my extension

597
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:29,016
2400 block and I set up an activation
rule

598
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:32,127
I this particular activation will says
my share extension

599
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:35,122
only once one image that's all you need
to giving I don't care about anything

600
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:40,100
else this is one time relevant

601
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,025
and now my view controller so have mine

602
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:47,109
you controller subclasses from es el
cumple service we control our

603
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:51,073
now take a look at the implementation
before Easter & Co to this

604
00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:54,094
I want to talk about a couple artificial
constraints for this demo app so for

605
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:54,169
purposes

606
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,126
up showing off the remaining characters
count and I generally updating the post

607
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:00,075
button

608
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,154
I'm gonna say that my photoblog has two
constraints associated with it

609
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:07,108
the first is that no photo can be posted
with more than 20 characters

610
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:11,015
a alongside the photo because it's meant
to just let you see the photo and not

611
00:36:11,078 --> 00:36:12,129
get distracted by the text

612
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:15,121
and also it's supposed to be a
lightweight for a block it doesn't wanna

613
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,029
spend it on a storage space on the
photos

614
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:22,033
so no photo that you post can be bigger
than one megabyte

615
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:25,086
and this class constraint is
particularly important because when you

616
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,103
pull data from the host application

617
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:32,017
you're not in control of the day decide
if you've got a photo coming from Photos

618
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:32,020
app

619
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:35,106
it might be quite large and therefore
its your extensions responsibility down

620
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:37,038
sample that image data

621
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:41,039
to fit within your size constraints

622
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,044
so let's start implementing the view
controller

623
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:47,132
so I'm gonna add an image data property
to my subclass this is going to be the

624
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:50,032
fully down sampled image data

625
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:53,119
that i'm gonna ultimately upload to the
photoblog

626
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:59,063
I'm going to keep track of the audience
that be user wants to post it to you

627
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:02,078
and I'm gonna keep configuration item
that i'm gonna talk about a little bit

628
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:02,087
later on

629
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:06,155
basically this represents that audience
bigger table cell down in the bottom

630
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:12,149
have the compose key

631
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:16,098
all right sir you did load we're going
to you

632
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:19,140
initialize the audience we already have
a utility routine in our apt knows have

633
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,091
attached the right default audience
based on a number of factors so we're

634
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:26,115
just gonna use that code from the app

635
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:31,027
now a those constraints I was talking
about the twenty character limit

636
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:35,044
and the down sampling both need to
affect whether the post button

637
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:39,048
is enabled so if the user is tight more
than 20 characters

638
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,057
we don't want them to be able to post if
the down samples not finished

639
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:46,091
likewise we don't want them to be able
to post so we need to make sure the post

640
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:48,110
button is disabled in those cases

641
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:52,064
also since we're using the remaining
character count indicator

642
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:55,142
we need to make sure that up to date at
all times the right place to do that

643
00:37:56,042 --> 00:38:00,067
is the is content valid method SL
compose service view controller calls

644
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:00,114
your

645
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:04,017
subclasses is content valid method
whenever it needs to update the status

646
00:38:04,044 --> 00:38:06,053
on the post button to give your chance
to do those things

647
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:11,081
for temperament some other the first
thing I want to do is look at the

648
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,092
are number of characters that the users
type so far

649
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,134
SL compose service be controller has a
content text property

650
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:23,082
which is the tax that these are state so
far so we grab a drink

651
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:25,157
next week after leaving number of
characters remaining based on our photo

652
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:29,121
blogs constraints

653
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:33,065
then we set eso composers Wii
controllers characters remaining

654
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:33,157
property

655
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:37,596
this is an NS number by setting that too
and in this number

656
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,150
the base class automatically updates the
text

657
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:44,100
on the composure she trefor start to
reflect the number of characters used to

658
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
have worked

659
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:56,035
to stand here so next we're going to
same

660
00:38:57,016 --> 00:39:01,023
that the post button should be enabled
if the user is not types too much text

661
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:05,099
and if we already have a fully down
sample image data otherwise

662
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,157
don't enable the post but now we've got
to get a fully down temple image data

663
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:13,059
and like I said this can be a
potentially expensive operations we

664
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,076
don't know how much data is going to be
coming over from the house

665
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:18,109
so we wanted to for that to presentation
animation did finish

666
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:23,073
this method is called by sub called on
subclasses a vessel compose service few

667
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:23,131
controller

668
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:30,072
after decompose she has slid up on
screen so the first thing we're gonna do

669
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:33,077
is look at the extension context again
and in particular look at the input

670
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:33,140
items

671
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,027
now I'm gonna go off from the read a
little bit here but bear with me

672
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:40,105
the extension context can have multiple
input items

673
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:45,084
on it each input item represents a
separate upload

674
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:50,161
block for most share extensions you only
care about doing one

675
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:55,075
uploaded the time but you might imagine
a particular sharing extension that

676
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:56,079
allowed to do

677
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,086
5 posts 21 social network at one go so
for that has hypothetical chair

678
00:40:01,086 --> 00:40:03,108
extension you're gonna need to look at
all the input items

679
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:08,075
but since this photo blog extension only
cares about posting one photo at a time

680
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,099
with one post at a time

681
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:15,172
we just look at the first input on next
we're going to iterate over all the

682
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:16,166
attachments

683
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:22,099
on that extension I'm I each extension
eat each post request could come with

684
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:23,121
multiple pieces a day to

685
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,032
like you could go into photos and select
two photos can choose to share that

686
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:31,033
you would have a extension contacts with
one item

687
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:35,044
with two attachments so we're going to
iterate over the attachments and find

688
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:36,065
the photo that we care about

689
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:39,132
so what we do is we

690
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:44,050
we iterate over all the other providers
in the extension item and we call has I

691
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:45,089
don't conform to type it in a fire

692
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:50,040
passing K U T tight image this is hey I
don't provider do you have an image in

693
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:50,125
you

694
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:54,037
and if we find out but the answer is yes

695
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:57,108
we're going to do some work we're gonna
need a poll that particular item

696
00:40:58,008 --> 00:41:01,080
fighters data and we're gonna wanna do
that on a background cue so as to not

697
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:05,076
hi disrupt the main thread and since we
found the one image that we support

698
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,132
we can stop generating now silly

699
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:13,047
actual work pulling the data happens
with the

700
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:16,086
load item for type identifiers options

701
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:20,114
completion had limited again saying
gimme some UT type

702
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:25,077
image please and the completion heavily
handle the past actually has a flexible

703
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:28,175
first parameter indicates the way you
would like the item provider to supply

704
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:29,134
your data

705
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:33,102
in this case my share extension is
interested in NSA a

706
00:41:34,002 --> 00:41:38,028
so that's what my completion has
protected and

707
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:42,046
win hi get the screw up for me

708
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:45,079
civic make this a wider that rap so much

709
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,102
I'm it's important to note

710
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:53,029
that no doubt have happened in a fire
completes on an arbitrary cue

711
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:56,037
and since we're going to view controller
work I'm gonna need to dispatch a sink

712
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:57,044
under the main cue to actually do that
work

713
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:03,016
and I'm gonna call a method on my psych
class called image data loaded finish in

714
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:03,069
passive

715
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:10,069
idea let's go implement that

716
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:18,051
so my application already has down
sampling code

717
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:21,072
right that's what it would need in the
normal case in normal application case

718
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,441
I'm just going to repurpose back

719
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:26,740
and ask it to down sample the image data
passing mapsize

720
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:29,077
and that's going to complete on an
arbitrary cue so again

721
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:33,027
once it completes I'm gonna give you
control it works I dispatch a sink onto

722
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:33,121
the main cue

723
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:37,022
and then I remember the down sample
image data

724
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:40,120
now that I've got that image data I need
a post button to get updated

725
00:42:41,002 --> 00:42:44,045
and the way I do that is call a method
on SL compose Wii controller called

726
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:48,101
Valatie content validate content calls
your subclasses

727
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,023
is content validated and gives it
another chance to determine whether or

728
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:52,067
not

729
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:59,067
that enable the post button

730
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:05,014
okay so when the user taps the post
button

731
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:09,108
on SL compose new controller subclass I
we call that subclasses

732
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:16,070
did select post method so let's react to
that the first thing we're gonna do is

733
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:17,008
perform the upload

734
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:21,094
and after that we need to tell the host
that are extensions done

735
00:43:21,094 --> 00:43:24,095
you can dismiss our view controller and
again we do that by calling methadone

736
00:43:25,004 --> 00:43:26,028
extension contest called

737
00:43:26,028 --> 00:43:30,030
complete request returning items
completion handler so it's at look at

738
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:30,087
the Apple again

739
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:34,049
so the upload is going to be very
similar to what I already showed on the

740
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:35,131
slides but let's go through it again
because it's

741
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:40,119
very important for extensions because
they have a short life span first thing

742
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:41,108
we're gonna do you

743
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:45,099
is create K background in a swirl
session configuration

744
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:50,131
create an issue or a session from that
configuration

745
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:55,031
and create a request representing the
upload

746
00:43:55,031 --> 00:43:59,035
now again this is code we stole must all
but called we borrowed from the main

747
00:43:59,035 --> 00:43:59,114
application

748
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:03,041
that building an issuer local request
from the photo data

749
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,064
I from the context that the user is
typing the audience

750
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:09,110
building upload task around that request

751
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:17,001
and then start that happen now in this
particular case

752
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:23,107
I well as he lets her back for a second
so we implemented it's like post method

753
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:28,062
eso composers view controller will also
call aidid select Cancel method

754
00:44:28,062 --> 00:44:31,068
on your subclass but in this particular
case

755
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,161
we don't need to implement the default
implementation and it's like cancer will

756
00:44:35,061 --> 00:44:37,135
go ahead and cancel the extension
context for you automatically

757
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:41,113
but if your extension needs to do some
cleanup work in response to a cancel

758
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,018
you can override it select Cancel so
that a No

759
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:49,072
to handle the basic uploading an
interaction with the sheet

760
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:52,124
but at the bottom of the sheet Murray
there is that little audience purcell

761
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:58,073
I'll show you how to implement that the
base class will call your subclasses

762
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,080
configuration items method

763
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:03,047
as a way to give your subclass a chance
to supply

764
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:06,103
that set a table cells to put on me
bottom out this year she

765
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:10,071
so we can implement the configuration
items method its are subclasses

766
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:11,109
responsibility

767
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:16,017
to return an array es el cumple she
configuration items

768
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:19,099
one for each configuration item in the
table now the example here

769
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,099
only has one configuration item but you
might imagine a

770
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:25,138
share extension that means multiples in
fact from the built-in system

771
00:45:26,038 --> 00:45:29,053
extensions have multiples configuration
and on the bottom

772
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:32,131
so we instantiate 1 and we said

773
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:36,040
title the title is what's displayed on
the left side of the table cell

774
00:45:36,004 --> 00:45:39,065
and we said its value which is the
audience displayed on the right side of

775
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:40,074
the table cell

776
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:44,085
and then we need to react to when that
table sellers tapped

777
00:45:44,085 --> 00:45:47,134
and when we do that is by setting a tap
handle on the configuration

778
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:51,131
now I'm gonna avoid to retain cycle
between my view controller

779
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:55,038
any configuration item but capturing a
weak reference to myself

780
00:45:55,038 --> 00:45:59,064
inside the tap handler and then what we
do is we got a strong reference to do

781
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:00,078
that week strong dance

782
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:03,080
and if our view controller is still
around I'm

783
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:06,113
at that point we know the table cells
been tapped we want to show that

784
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:08,051
audience paper you why

785
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:11,052
so we've already implemented in audience
pay-per-view controller

786
00:46:11,052 --> 00:46:14,107
it's just a basic table view controller
that happens to be in. specific for this

787
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:15,090
particular use

788
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:21,011
so we instantiate that we set ourselves
to be its delegate

789
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:24,094
our custom audience bigger view
controller class has a delegate method

790
00:46:24,094 --> 00:46:24,175
it's called

791
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:29,092
when the user taps an audience so that
we get to react to the specific audience

792
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:29,170
chosen

793
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:34,056
we're gonna tell it what the currently
selected audiences so I can check

794
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:42,019
the right thing and then we're gonna
commented on it so composed service you

795
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:46,006
control a telling it to please enemy
this other be controller on screen and a

796
00:46:46,024 --> 00:46:46,082
methodist

797
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:49,144
push configuration new controller so
this slides your

798
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:53,112
new view controller in a navigation
controller like style and resizes the

799
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:56,029
composure she to fit your view
controllers

800
00:46:56,029 --> 00:47:01,102
past desired size and then finally

801
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:06,019
noted we've implemented that we can
return are single configuration item

802
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:07,035
from configurations

803
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:13,036
alright so here is our delegate method
that is called when the audience pick

804
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:14,073
your view controller

805
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:19,076
sees the you tap a cell we need to react
to that we're gonna remember the

806
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:20,077
selected audience

807
00:47:20,077 --> 00:47:23,084
we're gonna tell our configuration item

808
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:26,093
hey it's got a new value and by doing
that the table cell is updated

809
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,147
automatically showing the new audience

810
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:32,068
and finally we want to honor dismiss

811
00:47:32,068 --> 00:47:35,115
that audience pay-per-view controller
I'm you don't have to lose

812
00:47:36,015 --> 00:47:39,056
it really depends on what your
configuration items needs are

813
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,061
but generally for this kind of simple
ideas picker want to tap a cell you

814
00:47:42,061 --> 00:47:43,119
wanted to swipe away

815
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:48,020
revealing the main computer she so this
is just a boilerplate code for executing

816
00:47:48,002 --> 00:47:49,077
code after a short delay

817
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:52,152
and then we call pop configuration new
controller

818
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:56,103
so in a navigation controller like way
this says remove the Thomas B controller

819
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:57,089
from the stack

820
00:47:57,089 --> 00:48:00,091
and since we only had one there it
restores the

821
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:04,015
the fall churches appearance

822
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:08,026
so that is it let's go ahead and rerun
misguided take a look at it one more

823
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:15,026
time

824
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:19,073
for a blog at thats hometowns

825
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:24,045
go back to photos user photo

826
00:48:24,045 --> 00:48:27,050
weekend bring up the photo by extension
and there it is

827
00:48:27,095 --> 00:48:33,126
we can choose an audience make a comment

828
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:40,065
and pursuant so that's how you make a
shared vision for Iowa's

829
00:48:40,065 --> 00:48:44,090
but if you are looking at the expo
project closely you can see that there's

830
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:44,478
a couple

831
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:50,040
West End targets and their I'm now it
turns out that shared

832
00:48:50,004 --> 00:48:53,090
yeah tights more stuff that's your
extensions

833
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:57,043
are very portable now it was pretty easy
for me to take my eyelash extension

834
00:48:58,024 --> 00:49:03,393
and massage the coat a little bit for OS
10 and so that is working here

835
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:06,630
I can go to some photos

836
00:49:06,063 --> 00:49:12,064
select a full preview it bring up the
share menu

837
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:15,168
painters my photo blog item and there's
my OS 10

838
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:23,068
thought about poor countries he so that
demo was all about a subclass a vessel

839
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:31,464
compose service view controller

840
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,930
but we know a lot of attention
developers are gonna wanna just subclass

841
00:49:34,093 --> 00:49:34,160
from UAB

842
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:38,025
you can't roller and SQ controller and
we'd love you to do that cuz you can go

843
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:41,690
to town and customize the wine for your
branding and whatnot

844
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:44,165
but the basic work that you need to do
beyond implementing the new controller

845
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,089
is pretty much what Aaron change in the
demo

846
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:50,152
you get those in populous concerns you
need is still set your alarm

847
00:49:51,052 --> 00:49:54,139
your display name are you need still
provide your activation rules

848
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,071
and you still need to do your upload
within an issue or a background section

849
00:49:58,071 --> 00:50:03,073
see just learned

850
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:07,123
all about ap extensions you learned a
little bit about to have a packaged

851
00:50:08,023 --> 00:50:11,059
about the different extension points
have a communication works between the

852
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:11,065
host

853
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:15,048
and the extension itself you learn how
to make

854
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:18,140
a today which it and a share extension
on both I O S

855
00:50:19,004 --> 00:50:22,052
and OS 10 so go take a look at your
applications

856
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:25,127
figure out what pieces if you're sharing
functionality or other functionality

857
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:29,122
you can package up into an act extension
and deployed so we think this is really

858
00:50:30,022 --> 00:50:33,098
cool technology and we're really looking
forward to all the good features and

859
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:35,123
functionality you're able to supply
users

860
00:50:36,023 --> 00:50:43,023
with your extensions here

861
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:49,031
KK ranges are super evangelist we have
really comprehensive ap extensions

862
00:50:49,085 --> 00:50:50,090
programming guide

863
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:53,057
goes into tons in detail on all the
SharePoint and all the mechanics in all

864
00:50:54,038 --> 00:50:54,077
this

865
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:58,118
tomorrow we have another great extension
session where we go into detail on more

866
00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:00,025
more SharePoint

867
00:51:00,025 --> 00:51:03,121
I we also talk about more the underlying
infrastructure

868
00:51:04,021 --> 00:51:08,067
we also go into great detail on the
JavaScript support for web content

869
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:12,080
and importantly more detail on the
extension context in an aside a provider

870
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:14,014
so there's tons a good information I
received a check those out

871
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:19,032
we have two labs where you can talk to a
sample engineers would love to get you

872
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:20,143
started implementing your share
extensions

873
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:25,047
one of those labs immediately after this
so previous downstairs would love to

874
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:25,081
chat

875
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:25,133
thank you
