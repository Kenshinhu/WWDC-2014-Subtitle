1
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:17,059
good morning welcome the 770 to managing
Apple devices

2
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,094
of I wasn't expecting that enthusiastic
a welcome this early in the morning

3
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:24,108
on top Fernandez and I am very happy to
be here with you

4
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,027
even at this ridiculously early hour
protectees like me

5
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:31,340
although for some %uh view this may be
the middle if your day

6
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:35,062
if you work in schools are otherwise
have to wear a tie to work many of us

7
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:38,103
are far more likely to see this hour at
the end of a long native coding

8
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:43,085
than at the beginning of our day now
open by recognizing our differences

9
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,119
because the sessions content is intended
for a diverse audience

10
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,848
from MDM vendors need to learn how to
take full advantage

11
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:54,580
the powerful device management
capabilities that we've built into I was

12
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:55,135
8 and Austin your sanity

13
00:00:56,035 --> 00:01:00,984
to app developers who want to understand
how the app's may be used in schools and

14
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,010
businesses

15
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,064
to administrators who need to know what
changes are coming

16
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:10,070
in the US releases this year when I
stand before you here last year

17
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:14,061
I was thrilled to announce two huge
leaps forward imagine Apple devices

18
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:19,027
in addition have managed distribution to
our volume purchase program

19
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:22,058
and the introduction of the device in
rolling programme

20
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:25,090
which create highlighted in the air
price action yesterday's keno

21
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,034
hard to believe there was another price
action at the keynote that was very

22
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:29,111
exciting to see

23
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:37,011
when we

24
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,150
set out to create the device in Roman
program we did so after wondering

25
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:44,044
why does it have to be painful to do
that initial configuration of your

26
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:44,171
devices

27
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,139
before handing them out to the user's
and we started by asking a simple

28
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,120
question

29
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:53,030
why can it be as easy as just unboxing

30
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:57,085
that device and handing iPad or that
iPhone that Mac to it's User

31
00:01:57,085 --> 00:02:00,158
it turns out many you are asking the
same question

32
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:05,086
am very pleased to report that our
customers are just as thrilled by the

33
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:06,095
transformative nature this new service

34
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:10,105
as we'd hoped one noteworthy example

35
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:15,004
is a macchiato with a high school in
Florida who

36
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,190
believe that we in the indie turned this
dream into reality

37
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:22,208
and they proved it by completely
replacing their free to buy pads

38
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,900
with 600 new iPad airs including
restoring all this to naps

39
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:31,064
and data from my cloud in two and a half
hours in a wonderful video showing just

40
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:32,109
how they did it

41
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,010
and if you've never seen the device on a
program in action

42
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:40,072
I highly recommend checking it out since
we last met

43
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,174
we've been very busy launching match
distribution last fall

44
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:49,075
the device are on the program a few
months ago and we've also been busy

45
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:53,162
adding all these features to fill in the
gaps

46
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:57,147
and smooth out the inconsistencies
between I O S and I was 10

47
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:02,061
so the vendors like some %uh view
creating device management tools

48
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,124
and administrators using those tools
have a much easier time

49
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:11,059
managing all their Apple devices this
session is going to cover the entire

50
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:14,088
life cycle device management including
both new tools

51
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:17,177
into existing tools and technologies and
all the changes coming in

52
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:22,104
I was 8 analyst in Yosemite and we'll
show you how they all come together

53
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:26,953
to provide a great experience for both
the administrators and their end-users

54
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,130
from enrolling devices in your
management solution of choice

55
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:34,232
to distributing content all those
devices

56
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,430
to the day-to-day ongoing management
tasks that come up

57
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:42,080
as time goes on and needs change so
let's dive right in

58
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:46,031
talk about enrolling devices a course
management

59
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:50,182
fanart I'm on advice from a program the
best way to do this

60
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,680
also at talk about Apple configurator as
an alternative way to enroll your device

61
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,151
you also need to be aware of how to
manage activation lock on supervised

62
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:02,117
devices and be thinking about that and
Roman time

63
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:06,041
and then I'll conclude with what's
coming

64
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,510
in this year's OS releases so before we
go any further I want to make sure that

65
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,973
everyone understands what advice from

66
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,886
program is and is not so every Latino
audience participation with going

67
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,650
although I appreciate all the responses
already

68
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:22,294
the Viceroy program is not an Indian
server

69
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,250
might say with me the Viceroy program is
not an MDM server

70
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:30,074
thank you though you know they're both
three letter acronyms

71
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:34,613
those are you with legalized note
they're not the same three letters

72
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,355
in fact the device loan program is the
best way to get your devices enrolled in

73
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,960
whatever Indian solution you're going to
use

74
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:44,825
it's an easy button to get your devices
in your MDM server

75
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,870
it's really two parts a way for
administrators to specify which settings

76
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:55,466
they want to use when their devices are
enrolled in their management solution

77
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:59,313
and the integration of the completion of
that enrollment process right into the

78
00:04:59,889 --> 00:04:59,985
normal setup X

79
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,210
assistant process that the user will go
through on those I less

80
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:08,115
analyst 10 as a I mention we launch this
in February

81
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:13,068
with devices eligible that are purchased
via direct sales in the US

82
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:16,087
and we've heard all the feedback loud
and clear that you'd like to see is

83
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,701
expanded to you

84
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:21,860
additional countries and channels so I'm
very pleased at all that we only

85
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:21,855
launched this

86
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,638
a few months ago we've already expanded
access to our neighbors to the north

87
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:32,150
and create Canadians here I'm so sorry
about the Canadiens

88
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:35,654
but in fact the Rangers not my Flyers
out in the first round cell

89
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,792
get it next year

90
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,891
we've also made a number of other
changes already since launch you know

91
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,624
what I want to point out

92
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,391
devices are now eligible up to three
years in the past if you purchase them

93
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,330
up to three years ago

94
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:52,034
Anderson enhancements the portal that
allow you to set the fall

95
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:55,111
and %um server so that a new device
purchases will automatically be assigned

96
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:59,540
to that Indian server without you need
to take further action

97
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,641
you can also now see which
administrators assigned which devices

98
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:06,734
with to which and %um servers and
another coming soon

99
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,680
expansion eligibility is that when
devices that are in the device on a

100
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:10,707
program

101
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,360
are replaced by service those devices
will soon be

102
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:18,765
remaining the device on the program
including retroactively

103
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,094
devices have been replaced over the past
three years we think customers will

104
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,595
really appreciate that

105
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,672
you quickly recap exactly how the

106
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,894
this service works before I go into
details especially for the Indian

107
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,126
vendors

108
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:37,063
customer purchases devices that
information is fed into the device on

109
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,715
the program

110
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,990
when the customer are provides their
account information to their MDM

111
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,058
solution and %um solution can download

112
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:49,954
device information from the program the
administrator can then specify the

113
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:50,053
settings

114
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,591
upload those to the program then when
users

115
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:57,088
open the box and start working walking
through the Setup Assistant

116
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,357
the device receives its settings from
the device from a program

117
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:04,157
which tell to enroll with the MDM server

118
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:07,313
now so again want to emphasize that once
that happens the icing on the program

119
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,076
has done its job

120
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,215
out of the picture and your MDM solution
is the only thing that's talking to the

121
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,902
devices

122
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,998
three talk about three topics a few
moments here

123
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:23,650
related to the national program how best
to integrate this into your nvm

124
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:26,023
solutions

125
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:30,933
so the first concept is where should the
ultimate repository the truth

126
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:36,514
relating to you the program the devices
in the settings for reside

127
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,050
the device information should really be
in the device our own program a treat

128
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:43,084
that is the truth you can always fetch
that information from the service to

129
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,172
your Indian server

130
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:47,621
but the settings that the administrator
decides to apply to certain groups

131
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,240
devices your server should really
further

132
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:54,413
out tree itself as the truth for that it
can always upload new settings to the

133
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:55,682
program

134
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,191
one caveat here to keep in mind though
and is

135
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,550
what I explain the previous lied even if
the administrator changes the

136
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:07,061
the settings they were in the device
Roman program for particular device or

137
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,200
devices

138
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,836
those devices will not see those
settings until the next time that they

139
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:12,633
go through activation

140
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,771
after wiping and going back to the Setup
Assistant the device is already enrolled

141
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,906
and you happen to change the setting to
say well now I want to be supervised

142
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:25,152
that will take effect until the next
time the device is set up

143
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,237
alright so disowning devices you may be
thinking what does that mean

144
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,775
well this is removing a device in the
device a rolling programme

145
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,250
and I'm here to scare you

146
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:39,062
a recommendation is to not implement
this feature

147
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:42,981
why is that well if and if you're gonna
break rule number one

148
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,581
you need to really really how many
released put on

149
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,880
really make sure they understand the
consequences that they will not be able

150
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:52,096
to undo this action and get that device
back into the program

151
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:57,087
so again we recommend following rule one

152
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,113
alright a final topic is thinking about
the combinations are to the type

153
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:04,095
have to have the specific in Rome in
settings that you can configure for

154
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:04,159
device

155
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,077
whether a supervisor not and whether
that and %um enrollment

156
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:11,115
can be removed or not by the user on the
device

157
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:15,086
and their at our own profile managers
taken the approach

158
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:18,090
have not separating the settings that if
you

159
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,028
choose to supervise device it
automatically the Indian enrollment

160
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:25,016
is not removable that top right box

161
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,083
the bottom right box is forbidden at if
you try to upload settings

162
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:35,075
where devices is not supervised any
Indian ron is not removed by the user

163
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,168
the service will reject those settings
the lower left but may be interesting

164
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:44,125
again profile manager doesn't a welp
that's what profound does if you don't

165
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,096
check the supervised box that it's
completely open

166
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:51,112
it's not supervised and user can undo
the and the enrollment

167
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:55,043
those two are really interesting ones
they're kinda half one in the upper left

168
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,101
is allowed but

169
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:00,007
probably not super interesting to
supervise the ice but still allow the

170
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:00,082
user to

171
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:03,099
on Raw from MTN

172
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:06,171
so thats couple notes about the device
in on the program

173
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:10,160
let's talk a bit about Apple
configurator so again Apple configurator

174
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,028
is also

175
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:15,095
not an MDM server wanna make sure it was
clear about that

176
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:19,153
but it is an alternative way to
installing Roman settings on

177
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:24,079
a particular I was device over US P as
an alternative to using device in on the

178
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,083
program over-the-air

179
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:31,091
once the settings have been lodged
device the actual request to go to Union

180
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:31,178
server to

181
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,165
complete the enrollment are
indistinguishable from whether they were

182
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:35,136
done

183
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,041
the settings got there over-the-air or
over USB

184
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:42,161
however you can teacher server to
distinguish between the two

185
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:46,069
if you check to see if that particular
device that in rolling

186
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:51,072
is in the the list that you got from the
device running program

187
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,147
also if the device has already gotten
its settings from the device running

188
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:56,048
program

189
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:59,050
configure will not overwrite settings

190
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:03,078
one additional caveat is that delivering
your own settings via the device in

191
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:04,121
Roman program

192
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:08,038
is the only way that you can make your
Indian Roman not removal

193
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:14,083
user another recommendation and one that
we found ourselves in profile manager is

194
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:18,158
that it's probably a good idea to offer
administrators the option to disallow

195
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:23,073
installing settings over USB if you want
to ensure that they only get there

196
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:26,135
your institutions devices only get their
settings that you specified

197
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:30,042
that that will prevent

198
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:33,060
a user from using figure to you install

199
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,090
like settings that allow enrollment in
European server without supervising for

200
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:40,052
example

201
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:43,098
let's now talk a little bit about
activation lock management

202
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:47,129
so by default supervise device does not
allow the user to enroll

203
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,045
in active are to enable activation lock

204
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,053
but there is no way that we introduced

205
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:58,118
her in in the spring that

206
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,081
and EM can request a bypass code that
allows

207
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,143
Union search later or the administrator
later clear activation lock without

208
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:06,107
needing

209
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:10,022
the user's password

210
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,074
at that time there's also an Indian
commander can tell the device walking

211
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:15,140
now you can allow the user to enable
activation moxie

212
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:20,029
want to do all this at enrollment time
if in fact your institution wants to use

213
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:20,150
activation lock

214
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:24,033
which is great feature

215
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,079
we also recommend that once your tree
that activation

216
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:31,093
by activation lock bypass code that you
provide access to the administrator

217
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:33,185
to a in you live because it may be
useful to be able to enter it manually

218
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,121
on a device that for

219
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:40,097
whatever reason is not currently
reachable i dnt answer

220
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:44,105
there are three new Indian commands to
retrieve the code

221
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:48,006
to then delete it from the device so
that no one can can grab

222
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:51,007
of the devices they get physical access
to it

223
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:54,068
and then of course to enable the are
allow the device to enable activation

224
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,076
lock

225
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:58,088
then we strongly recommend that when
you're completing the and the enrollment

226
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,181
that at that time you always retrieve
and then clearly a

227
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,163
the bypass code from the device because
it's only available for 15 days after

228
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:08,075
the device was supervised

229
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:11,163
you should also say that bypass code
even if a particular device is on a roll

230
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,145
from Indian because activation lot may
still be enabled and you may still need

231
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,058
to clear it

232
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:20,113
and the device can later re in roll and
there won't be another opportunity to

233
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:21,045
get

234
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:27,092
a bypass code until the rice is white
and angry supervised

235
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:30,134
says the pops I wanted to cover on
enrolling but I'm

236
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:34,106
I'm also happy to tell you that there's
an important change how device

237
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:39,073
responds when the enrollment been
completed and setup assistant

238
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:43,077
and I know your servers all really
excited the mysteries have no doubt

239
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:46,150
specified lot settings and absent all
sorts things they want delivery devices

240
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:48,069
soon as its unrolled

241
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:52,036
however the device isn't ready to
respond all those requests while the

242
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:54,083
user is still completing Setup Assistant

243
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,102
so now when any of these Indian commands
are sent to the device

244
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:02,011
while it is still in the Setup Assistant
will return the not now status

245
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:05,060
so your server can no hay devices
already on their way

246
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:08,019
until it returned turns successful
enrollment

247
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:11,159
and then you can start completing your
in aromatase

248
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,137
configuration tasks so that further ado
i'd like to show you how this works

249
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:20,081
and I'm gonna invite my colleagues you
sit back and mark up

250
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:25,116
to show you a demo other rowing devices

251
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:29,065
alright are affected so you we have and
out a box

252
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:32,069
freshly delivered new iPad basically it
was

253
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:36,080
or a purchase by the institution and did
go through some both the room

254
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,060
it was just handed straight to the user
and are proven to server

255
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:44,043
business R&D answer for palestinian are
knows about this device because

256
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:47,091
be time between devising Roman program
and program manager

257
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:50,094
and the device the purchase was made
through the channels so we know that

258
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:52,114
this device is configured for

259
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:56,090
our services so I'm going to walk
through the setup but as usual

260
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,009
I'm gonna pick my language Park alike
pick my country

261
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:02,046
connect to my network so at this point
the device is no

262
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,031
talking to the Apple services and our
attending its

263
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:09,098
activation information and it's part of
that information is the notice but

264
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:12,172
we are no in the EP and reader Tom

265
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:16,106
prompted for in rolling into Indian
server so

266
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:21,022
just in a second we are we're still
returning something information

267
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:24,026
and no we are talking to are server

268
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:27,048
so this is as far as DP has talked to
the device

269
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:30,133
now we're talking to are Indian server
and I can find more information about

270
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:31,089
some

271
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,089
for instance so if I need to know what
to do next I can call the I can help

272
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:35,160
desk

273
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:39,031
and up no I go to the next and you see
that

274
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:44,089
when I go forward I'm not prompted for
username and open password

275
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,111
I cannot bypass so I do have to enroll
this

276
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:51,094
so disturbed this device has been
configured to be supervised

277
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:54,993
and the Indian profile is mandatory so I
have no way of bypassing

278
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,620
this step so I'll provide my leg
information

279
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:04,091
and move on and no we don't want the
profiles from our Indian server

280
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:07,210
so again the the DP face has been has
been

281
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,680
complete I know we're talking to our are
management server

282
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:14,227
and Marcus said some screens to be pipe
last year

283
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,330
so we're not seeing registration and
other pieces and while I complete my set

284
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,118
up by looking into my ipod account

285
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:23,022
well have marks are you the set up in
the box yep

286
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:26,117
so answer using at their centers iPad
and I want to walk you through

287
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:31,018
how in profile manager we've implemented
you I to support configuring price wrong

288
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:32,020
program

289
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:36,002
so on left side you see the devices that
my server has

290
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:39,005
retreat from the National pretty much
there is configured to

291
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:43,035
download these devices and then I have
uses iPad slighted here and you can see

292
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,066
the enrollment settings

293
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,094
that I've got selected your our first
option

294
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:50,097
is whether turn on this configuration
for this device or not you can also put

295
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:52,042
these configurations

296
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:55,056
on device group as well so you can get a
whole collection devices get the same

297
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,094
settings

298
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:59,177
so we have checked on she wants and the
settings down the next option is whether

299
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:00,081
or not

300
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:04,061
the user is allowed to skip in Rome it
an

301
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:07,360
I just on the case uses device is not
allowed to skip enrollment he's can be

302
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,948
prompted for credentials country's first
directory server

303
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,120
our next option is whether I wanted you
over-the-air supervision of the device

304
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:18,071
now in addition to be on the supervisor
devices

305
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,201
when you surprise device you also have
the option locking the MDM profile so I

306
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,860
can't be removed from the device

307
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:26,925
in our case we've combined those into
one options within our customers

308
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,718
whenever the supervisor gonna want to
have locked in the AM if you're a

309
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:31,980
third-party Indian developer

310
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,800
you can always break that out and have
it as a separate option

311
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:41,973
the next texting is whether you want to
allow pairing

312
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:46,340
so I have that a No so the price
comparison Mac you want annexes to you

313
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,097
request credentials for enrollment
seaside you see

314
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:51,146
prices prompted for credentials and then
there are various things that we can

315
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:55,255
skip during the setup show or sleeping
step assistant I'll

316
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,708
in our case we have Apple ID enable
because you want to capture

317
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,480
uses about we get activation lock in a
month am

318
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,073
so you see is finished actually setting
up his device

319
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:08,146
so I am going to you

320
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,875
show you our security thanks for the
device right now show that activation

321
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,090
lock is unable but I do have the
activation like bypass cuz this is what

322
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:20,688
a provide major grappling device was
rolled if I

323
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:26,590
update my info now that he's done

324
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:29,278
we'll see in a moment here that
activation like a change to yesen

325
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,860
and by my phone is enabled is is set yes
so

326
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:36,119
I'm so when this device comes back to me

327
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:40,848
I'll be able two runs clear activation
lock if activation like is still unable

328
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,360
and I can clear that and him this device
out to the next user

329
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:51,036
so back to yes

330
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,050
so you see mark just showed you how you
can enroll in supervise and I was device

331
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,990
using device in Roman program

332
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:01,238
and how to configure the enrollment
settings that were used

333
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,180
using profile manager but of course that
can be done with any and %um solution

334
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:07,667
that supports the icing on the program
will help all

335
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,100
you mark show you how profile murder had
retrieved the activation lapse bypass

336
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:16,049
code as a complete enrollment to that
device

337
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:19,277
and then a provider actually

338
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,190
automatically allows active care there's
a setting and Roman setting which I

339
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,024
don't know that mark showed

340
00:19:24,024 --> 00:19:27,085
that the measure can choose always
automatically allow automation

341
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:32,096
activation lock 16 retrieved by
successfully retrieved by passcode

342
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:35,133
let's move on to our the next section
are talking talk about streaming content

343
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,212
to our devices

344
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:41,584
records gonna talk about the volume
purchase program in mass distribution

345
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:45,740
we'll talk a little bit about manage
taps and then conclude with

346
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:48,171
the significant enhancements in I was a
analyst in Yosemite

347
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,230
to fill in some gaps here

348
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:55,886
so again to recap mass distribution
allows

349
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,230
the administrator to buy licenses
instead of codes

350
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:03,034
which can be Rep revoked and reallocate
to differ user

351
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:07,048
for both aP's and books

352
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:11,707
and we provided ATI se nvm solutions can
integrate the service into their

353
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:18,156
their solutions and it's currently
available in 10 countries

354
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,440
so again refresher exactly how this
works the initiator can purchase

355
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:27,061
like absent books in the people and
information stored in the iBookstore on

356
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,620
the App Store

357
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,244
when they provide their account
information to their management solution

358
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,921
it can download information about which

359
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,137
absent books have been purchased
intervale for assignment

360
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:43,360
it can send assignments up to the iTunes
Store in credit a particular app or book

361
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,005
to you a

362
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,962
a user account when the user configures
their Apple ID on a particular

363
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,845
Apple device they'll see those
assignments in their purchase list

364
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,346
and can download the bits directly from
the store just as if they had purchased

365
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:59,320
them themselves

366
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:02,471
and also the administrator can send
command and %um commands from the server

367
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,850
to the devices to say

368
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:07,254
download this app to make sure that it
is actually installed on a particular

369
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:11,057
device

370
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:14,458
again dive into a number of topics
relates the vine purchase program to

371
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:17,016
give you some advice on how to best
integrate these

372
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,323
this program into your solutions
starting off again with

373
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,934
where should the different pieces a
truth reside

374
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:28,950
and the DVD service itself should really
be the truth for

375
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:31,904
the status user romance whether a user
has accepted an invitation

376
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,760
and associated your Apple ID with the
user

377
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,844
which licenses have been purchased as I
action on the previous slide

378
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,960
as well as tracking any irrevocable book
assignments that have been made

379
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:47,305
you're in the answer should actually be
the truth for everything else

380
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,242
including revocable ap assignments and
you may be wondering why shouldn't that

381
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:53,860
be in the BB service

382
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:56,635
well if you're and in solution supports
group assignments you need to keep that

383
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,460
information your and %um server because
there's no way to store

384
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:03,615
group information in the DPP service so
you're gonna be able to reconstitute

385
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:08,104
that you can you have all that within
your database

386
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,857
let's talk a little bit about account
management when particular administrator

387
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,571
provides their credentials their their
VP account to your solution

388
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,776
and you want to stab the initial
connection with the bond purchase

389
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:21,649
program

390
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:25,651
you're going to you need to check the
client context attributes and if it's

391
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,740
empty and

392
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,700
that means that no other server has
claimed the counter is using this

393
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:29,826
account

394
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:33,558
and you should go ahead and claim it by
providing the hostname your server and a

395
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:34,480
unique

396
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:39,083
a I do it so that you'll be able to tell
whether your server still on managing

397
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:43,522
if their look like context as a value
and it doesn't match the good that you

398
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,480
have for that server

399
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:48,567
some other server is actually using that
account and you're gonna want to alert

400
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,080
the administrator that some other server

401
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:54,297
is managing licenses tied to this
account

402
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:57,432
and ask them to confirm that you have
they in fact one the server to take over

403
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:58,090
that account

404
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,918
that may in fact be the right thing if
their chance transitioning from one

405
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,470
server to the next

406
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:07,120
and further whenever you reestablish the
connection to the service

407
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:11,601
you need to check my contact again to
make sure that your server still the one

408
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,868
that's connected to this account if it
doesn't match any longer you can

409
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:19,580
need to start making request to the
service an alert the administrator

410
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,405
that this other host name has now claim
this account so they can take

411
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:27,054
appropriate action

412
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,600
nationalizations already thats apart

413
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,350
bootstrapping this program is that
mister needs to

414
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:37,036
invite each user to link their Apple ID
you

415
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:42,061
this particular the PP account so that
licenses can be a sign

416
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:45,860
we strongly recommend that you do this
invitation the NDM you can

417
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:49,424
easily send that invitation be an Indian
command directly to an Android device

418
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,620
it's much more secure

419
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,960
and are reliable email is a fallback

420
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:58,195
if you have a user you need to invite
doesn't currently have an Android device

421
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:03,147
but there's a concerning need to beware
that because the invitation URL there's

422
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,616
an example on screen

423
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,600
country as for the Apple the Condamine
many

424
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:12,905
mail servers will treat an email coming
from your servers domain

425
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,566
including a URL from a Apple dot com has
a phishing attack

426
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:22,178
and the filter them out their number
alternative ways to avoid this problem

427
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,311
you could create your invitation email
URL that brings these are first factor

428
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:27,779
in the AM server

429
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,781
before redirected into the PP URL or you
can integrate innovate invitation

430
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,570
process right into your User Portal if
you have one

431
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:40,746
first spend a few moments talking again
about user ID's

432
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:44,325
relating to bond purchase program I sure
the slide last year

433
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,940
there are really three ideas have the
user is

434
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:51,273
from the perspective of the MDM server
from

435
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,122
perspective at the BP service and in the
end users Apple ID

436
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,580
which your Indian server will never see
directly by

437
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:02,737
will see a hash other to protect users
privacy

438
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:06,330
now this will be very simple if we lived
in the ideal world

439
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:10,033
where each user had one and only one
Apple ID associated with

440
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:13,107
your VP Account and would never change
that Apple ID

441
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:17,926
in this case be a simple one to one
mapping between all three these

442
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,990
representations that the user

443
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:24,030
sadly as many you may be aware we don't
live in an ideal world

444
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:27,357
in the real world multiple VP users can
accept

445
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:31,816
their individual invitations with the
same Apple ID and need to be aware the

446
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:32,157
implications are

447
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,076
the sharing about ladies specifically if

448
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,508
you've assigned a license to a user that
then is connected to that particular

449
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,408
Apple ID

450
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:44,720
if you revoke that assignment it's going
to look at from every Apple

451
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:49,731
every user sharing that Apple ID also if
you try to assign

452
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:53,950
a Napper book to you I EP user

453
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:56,274
that's associated with an Apple ID that
already has

454
00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:02,166
that a ap or book a sign that second
assignment will fail

455
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:05,540
another issue in the real world is that
users can

456
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:08,933
after accepting invitation with one
Apple ID can

457
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,149
dissociate from Apple ID and associate
accept an invitation with the different

458
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:13,221
Apple ID

459
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:17,080
this becomes a problem if you assign any
irrevocable book

460
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:20,073
licenses to you that happen like that
retired Apple ID

461
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:23,074
you have to keep track of that and think
about whether you want to allocate

462
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:29,146
another irrevocable book license to the
new Apple ID or not

463
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,695
so the NDM service representation of the
user the client user ID string

464
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:38,480
is something that's under your control
and we strongly recommend you pick a

465
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:39,727
value that will never change

466
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,161
for example the user ID from the
directory services where you're getting

467
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:43,720
your

468
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,841
user and group information Shinshu
something like an email address which

469
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,583
can change

470
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:53,440
and it's very simple I had to have a
slide with some people on I'm sorry

471
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:57,413
at it's very easy then to look up which
EP account that that particular

472
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:01,821
and the end user is associated with
whether it's just registered and you

473
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,973
sent the invitation or actually
associated

474
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,431
where the user has accepted

475
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:11,190
and finally the representation have the

476
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:14,638
users Apple ID accepted the invitation
takes the form and

477
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,850
I can store ID hash and you to track
this

478
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:20,354
as soon as a user has accepted an
invitation

479
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,230
new and I was a there's now an Indian
query

480
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:27,462
not just in I would say it's also
interested in your sanity

481
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,090
a query to get that hash values so that
you can now with

482
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:34,348
whether the Apple ID thats

483
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,950
configured on a particular device
changes you won't know exactly what the

484
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:37,146
Apple I'd

485
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:41,095
ideas but you'll be able to tell if they
dissociated angry associated with the

486
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:43,514
different I D

487
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,373
as I i mentioned already on the previous
slide you gonna want to track those

488
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:47,506
retired

489
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:52,440
values if the user switches to a
different Apple ID

490
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:58,103
again see cue track any irrevocable book
assignments

491
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:01,538
another new change that will allow your
you and your vendors provide a better

492
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:02,975
user experience in your tools

493
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,760
for users outside the US that we now
report the country code

494
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:10,886
that the account is tied to you when you
get your information down from the

495
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:11,720
service

496
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:14,083
so that you can fetch the proper at
midday to artwork

497
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:21,083
description at name from the correct
iTunes Store

498
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:25,114
so mashups is not a new a new concept
with her for a couple

499
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,450
I was releases its away for

500
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:31,714
enterprises to keep better control over
their data and documents tied a

501
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,132
particular aP's

502
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:36,287
it works with both App Store and
enterprise aP's

503
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:40,720
they manage that must be installed the
MDM

504
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:43,861
with the install application command and
with the management like set on the app

505
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:46,513
itself

506
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:49,624
one limitation is that if the user is
already installed an app the Indian

507
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:50,371
server cannot

508
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,068
converted to manage retroactively
however the circuit court's detector

509
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,573
up is unmanaged and then alert the
administrator so they could take

510
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:03,970
action outside any and if necessary to
you

511
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:07,786
have the user to leave that up and nvm
server push it out again

512
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,681
mashups work with managed to open in new

513
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:15,470
feature in I was seven to help again
prevent

514
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:19,836
data leakage from managed up to %uh nine
ish taps

515
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,326
so if you have a particular app that has
sensitive documents

516
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,960
you can't read it is managed turn on
managed opinion

517
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,785
and then users will not be able to open
those documents in other APs like

518
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:34,702
I won't name any so you might imagine I
talked about filling gaps

519
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:39,179
and learning in skin inconsistencies we
have managed apso

520
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,440
what are introducing in I was a well
course matchbooks

521
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:46,413
and just like managed aP's matchbooks
works with those

522
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,090
both iBookstore books where you can

523
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:53,568
I just like mash taps tell the device to
download

524
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:57,320
a particular iBookstore book entry is
managed

525
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:00,032
that that book must be published
persisted

526
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,121
DPP even if the user has it

527
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:07,470
one I'm difference between matchbooks
and mashups is that

528
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:10,696
you can rack retroactively manage books
in contrast to manage aP's

529
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,174
even if the user has an install this is
be very useful in schools to ensure that

530
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:17,330
a particular title is installed

531
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:21,038
make sure the students have all the work
in the doc didn't need it

532
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:24,482
turning to enterprise books

533
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:28,282
you can just like enterprise aP's can
install the and %um

534
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,770
and remove PS eap jobs and iBooks Author
books

535
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:37,830
these documents are the these titles are
stored in a different location for my

536
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,512
book store books

537
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:43,263
with classy data protection there are
also a number restrictions are

538
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,580
introducing I was a

539
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:47,134
to again give institutions more

540
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:51,673
confidence that the sensitive data will
be protected and not

541
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:55,018
escape their control they can disable

542
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:58,450
I called backups are these enterprise
books

543
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:01,122
they just stay on the device whether
install and also disable

544
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:08,531
the user's highlights and notes on that
title from being synced other devices

545
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:10,806
for you and the others out there it's
any pretty straightforward implement

546
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:11,960
this

547
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:14,635
just like there's an install application
and %um command there's now an install

548
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:15,576
media

549
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:19,308
and UN Command where if it's I managed

550
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:23,661
iBookstore book you to specify the
iTunes Store I D

551
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:26,935
and if it's an enterprise book you
specify a URL back to your server to

552
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,700
download the bits

553
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:32,836
you need to specify persist in ID under
control so you can uniquely identify

554
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:34,531
each

555
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,440
enterprise but this being installed and
its kind

556
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:42,253
and then the matching remove media
command

557
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:45,737
there are few limitations just like
manage taps

558
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,840
it requires the app installation and the
enrollment right to be able to install

559
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:51,243
manage books

560
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:55,014
and managing iBookstore books requires
that you again purchased

561
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:58,236
the DPP and that the App Store is
enabled on the device that you're

562
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,053
pushing an enterprise but you

563
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,396
another distinction between managed ups
and Nash books

564
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:08,796
is that the and the inquiry to attain
the listed in Starbucks

565
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:13,412
will only show managed books and not
every book that's installed by the user

566
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:16,970
to preserve user privacy and finally

567
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:20,036
against you allowed institutions to keep
control over these enterprise books in

568
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:21,948
their sensitive data

569
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:26,375
enterprise books cannot be sent off the
device using iTunes

570
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,830
returning from what's new and I would
say what's new in I was ten years so

571
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,272
many were gonna fill another gap

572
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:36,077
and we r have added the ability to
install on App Store

573
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:43,599
ups the NDN on Elliston

574
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:46,293
in thank you see when he gets back up so

575
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,107
it you can specify a sign flat package
containing a

576
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:54,655
years and AM committed install
application and UN Command which is now

577
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,930
supported on August 10

578
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:01,299
for night at Starbucks and in fact your
Indian solution can do this

579
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,590
same thing the profile name has done
that you can support the

580
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:07,758
administrators providing you with just I
got up on the low as long as you

581
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,830
package it up as a sign flat package and
send that over

582
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:15,172
the and the in command so without any
further ado i'd

583
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,920
instead of talking more about this i'd
like to ask you see mark come back up

584
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:19,102
and show you

585
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:23,914
installing and removing enterprise
absent works

586
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:28,542
alright thank you cards and I just moved
into my books library

587
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,946
so here we have some books that we were
diverted I've been a keen

588
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,194
reader a very Human Interface Guidelines
apparently and we just ordered a swift

589
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,094
so its books over gonna learn some new
things and marks not going to push

590
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:42,503
a PDF for for the device so this is
going to be on

591
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,960
enterprise so enterprise book and

592
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:50,190
this will have the same open rules I saw
us or any other

593
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:54,020
manage data on the device will have data
protection between applications

594
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:57,101
and we won't we won't be able to showed

595
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:01,343
through the book in a row so this is our
fans in you PDF I just got installed

596
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,720
and snow since this is a managed book
I'll controlled by Indians

597
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:08,201
and im our solution market can also
remove the book

598
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:12,853
so mark and no remove the app remove the
book and it disappears from our

599
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,710
from a box of so that's a managing books
on no oren

600
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:21,770
by your side and

601
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,580
I'm on Iowa so we've we've had be able
to install enterprise applications we

602
00:34:26,058 --> 00:34:26,114
have our

603
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:30,021
fancy use with application here acne hub

604
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:33,095
but I thought mention wheels up support
for installing applications and all this

605
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:33,174
time

606
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:38,095
so you re going to our launch pad and
mark is not going to install our

607
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:41,121
fancy backing up going to be our
standpoint

608
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:45,039
and no hands this is all our all
installed by

609
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,039
by the system so sparkles fly and the
acting up but landed in the system so

610
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:54,044
here's all standing committee happens

611
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:57,148
so thank you mark and now back to top

612
00:34:58,048 --> 00:35:02,120
I thank you very much guys that was
written using Swift right

613
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:06,089
they stayed up all night all rights cell

614
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:10,041
mark easy to show Dad installing a PDF
on I was a

615
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,114
device and removing it as well as
installing an enterprise app on a Mac

616
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:16,048
running OS 10 yosemite

617
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:19,089
so let's proceed onto our final section

618
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,147
and talk about ongoing management
devices

619
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:26,085
we're going to complete the the
activation lock story to show you

620
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:30,088
talk about how you use that bypass could
you change at an aroma thyme

621
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:36,029
talk a little about integrating and %um
solutions with external data sources

622
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:39,080
talk about something new rock called and
%um service can signal

623
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:42,061
come onto that a few minutes and then
again conclude with what's coming

624
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:46,039
in this year's OS releases

625
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:49,132
so one thing to keep in mind with
activation lock is

626
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:53,105
its it's a little bit different from
some other services

627
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:57,017
when you get the device information
query and Mark show this in profile

628
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:58,074
manager when he re fetched

629
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:02,077
the device information on it reflected
the changing activation lock status

630
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:06,084
there's a key that tells you whether the
device thinks its activation lot

631
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:10,125
and there's a a request that use and not
to the device but you

632
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:14,026
our activation server to clear the
activation lock

633
00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:17,048
and specify the bypass code that you
have

634
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:20,075
now because that request doesn't go to
the device

635
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:23,076
the device isn't checking with the
activation server it's not gonna know

636
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:25,153
that it's been cleared so it's going to
continue to report

637
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:30,085
that its activation locked year and the
answer

638
00:36:30,085 --> 00:36:34,139
also even after you have cleared it on
the activation server the user if they

639
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,112
lockout or the remove their Apple ID in
and login again that will really able

640
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:40,046
activation lock

641
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:43,081
so you wanna definitely keep hold up I
pass code even if you cleared it

642
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,176
this isn't gonna in the real world gonna
usually be an issue because typically

643
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:49,135
you can use this when you have the
device in your hands

644
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:53,043
but you definitely want you to bypass
kurds because you might need to use it

645
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:57,060
again

646
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:01,025
alright so one of the most important
external data sources the journey in

647
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,150
server needs integrate with is

648
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:06,063
directory services there are a number of
different ones that your server probably

649
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,017
supports

650
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:13,019
however compared to the database that's
back in European solution

651
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,065
most director services have some
capabilities which make unlimited

652
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:21,072
in this context usually you can't get a
phone operation other contents

653
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:25,040
and there's not an easy way to discover
the changes in the last time Feb some

654
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:25,160
subsection

655
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:30,051
contents they can be intermittent leave
a long slow

656
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:34,101
so you want me to mere Sai information
into your your server

657
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:39,018
in contrast redesigned both the device
Roman program service and the volume

658
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:40,073
purchase program service to be

659
00:37:40,073 --> 00:37:43,080
simple efficient to mir that data into
European solution

660
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:48,078
you can molinari the licenses for VP
your the device list for advice in Roman

661
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:49,083
program

662
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,132
and it's easy to get the changes from
the last time that you got an

663
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:53,085
enumeration

664
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:56,090
she definitely near this information
down in your database

665
00:37:57,035 --> 00:38:01,103
and not use those services for live
access

666
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:06,009
similarly you know when a mere in the
directory services information to get

667
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:08,110
better performance reliability and

668
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:13,002
all the benefits your database but
definitely the authentication peace in

669
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:14,038
directory services

670
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:18,113
less frequently used in you need to have
a single source of truth for that

671
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,015
also you're not gonna wanna near your
entire directory services into your

672
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:22,085
database

673
00:38:22,085 --> 00:38:29,085
course you want to just mere in records
that are related to you in the AM

674
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:32,167
next hour talk about a new concept that
those you familiar with the store back

675
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:37,069
from iTunes we can also call this the
URL bag

676
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:40,125
it's something that would make it much
easier for tools like Apple configurator

677
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:44,064
another device management tools to you
just asked the Indian server

678
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:48,128
what information they contain from the
from it

679
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:52,033
we specify this new you are I and the
inservice confetti

680
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:56,129
that any to look at them making art on
authenticated HTTPS request to your

681
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:57,094
server

682
00:38:57,094 --> 00:39:01,108
and ask you to provide in UCF Jason
could hash

683
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:06,012
for example the URL for your and %um
servers device in Roman program

684
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,041
enrollment

685
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:10,086
this would allow a tool like Apple
configurator to make it much easier for

686
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,095
administrator

687
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:14,158
to use it to configure settings because
they were not the type the entire

688
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:16,070
enrollment URL

689
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:19,098
they don't have to type the demand have
your server and it could then

690
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,122
after sir what's your URL and complete
that for the user

691
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:28,023
so we're gonna be it plain that sinn
profile manager and we struck we would

692
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:32,025
really like to see that in your Indian
solutions as well

693
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:35,088
again let's turn to what's coming knew
when I was 8 in terms

694
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:38,142
NTM commands inquiries we've seen some
these already

695
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:44,078
is now possible for supervised devices
to tell them scepter device name the MDM

696
00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:48,115
you can also clear the restrictions
passcode if the user has themselves

697
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:49,102
configured in

698
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:53,024
settings you why restrictions and set a
passcode

699
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:57,049
that would have prevented in the past
the administrator from overriding those

700
00:39:57,049 --> 00:39:58,066
restrictions

701
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:02,088
now you can send in NC and command that
removes the settings and allows the MDM

702
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:03,124
server to you

703
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:07,117
configure its own settings we've already
seen the new install and remove media

704
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:09,059
commands

705
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:12,092
as well as the query that allows you to
ask which

706
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:16,149
iTunes account is configured on the
device via the iTunes Store ID hash

707
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:21,051
but it's also now possible to query the
device to ask when it last backup to I

708
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,069
cloud

709
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:27,106
there are a number of new payloads and
additions to existing payloads and I was

710
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:29,029
a

711
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,030
there's a new VPN connection type

712
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:37,040
we added new plugin content filters to
expand on the built-in content filters

713
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:39,079
that we shipped in Iowa 7

714
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:42,096
there's a new paler called managed
remains which were gonna show you a

715
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:45,143
little bit later that you can have
managed email and web domains

716
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:50,071
that work in conjunction with manage
taps and books and managed opinion

717
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:55,084
and help institutions keep their data
secure

718
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:58,126
I think they actually mentions Craig
actually mention the per message

719
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:02,069
s months which in mail yesterday and
it's possible to configure whether

720
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:03,156
that's available to the user for both

721
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:08,083
email exchange you can specify
certificate in the single sign-on

722
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:08,159
payload

723
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:12,059
that allows automatic refreshing at the
Curragh

724
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,097
potentials without the user having to
take any action

725
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,108
and their number of new restrictions
both

726
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:22,057
for unsupervised devices 5 at the top
including

727
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:25,091
disabling than the it's really cool
feature hand-off but

728
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:29,129
that also me worry certain institutions
about

729
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,097
data that they're consider sensitive
transitioning from a managed device

730
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:36,102
to another device outside their control

731
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:41,085
we also Artie Saul the restrictions on
enterprise books

732
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:44,156
and there too new supervised
restrictions

733
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:47,141
that you can prevent the user from
erasing all content and settings and

734
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:52,057
lighting devices undoing all that hard
work you did to configure that device

735
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:55,068
as well as a pair for the Indian command

736
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:58,133
that once you clear the restrictions you
can disable the user from

737
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:02,076
actually configuring them

738
00:42:02,076 --> 00:42:05,081
using the US the like you I in settings

739
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:09,115
speaking at the device you line settings
the Irish team has done a lot of work to

740
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:12,089
dramatically improve the end-user
experience

741
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,092
to see the effects other than in the AM
enrollments and

742
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:19,041
any configuration profiles an Indian

743
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:22,102
in relationship is now represented with
a single item

744
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:27,084
that coalesces all the profiles are
installed the Indian channel

745
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:30,143
showing all the settings abs and books
that have come down view that in your

746
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:31,138
relationship

747
00:42:32,038 --> 00:42:35,081
with the most important things like
accounts and absent books restrictions

748
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:36,123
at the top

749
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:40,047
what this also means that users cannot
no longer cherry-picking remove

750
00:42:40,047 --> 00:42:43,129
individual profiles that the Indian
server has delivered to the device

751
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:47,102
just not shown that way

752
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:51,034
another improvement in the settings you
why is that if their particular features

753
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,065
like the camera in the restrictions you
I

754
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:56,084
in settings it will indicate to the user
that

755
00:42:56,084 --> 00:43:00,160
this particular features been disabled
due to a profile being installed

756
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:04,065
so that they don't they are confused
need to come to James Barath

757
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:08,042
why the camera is disabled

758
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:11,059
it's also much easier to see all the
certificate details have been delivered

759
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:15,145
and %um and finally pro provisioning
profiles no longer appear at all

760
00:43:16,045 --> 00:43:19,050
in settings because its handle
completely automatically the device will

761
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:19,153
automatically

762
00:43:20,053 --> 00:43:27,053
through expired provisioning profiles
when they're no longer needed

763
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:32,046
one less thing to worry about turning 20
s tenure seventy

764
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:35,137
you'll see that we've support we have
support for a number the new pillows I

765
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:38,044
already talked about I was eight

766
00:43:38,044 --> 00:43:41,051
as well as the query to you determine
which

767
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:44,053
iTunes account has been configured on
that particular Mac

768
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:49,087
and we also have have for another gap in
adding the commands that tells a Mac to

769
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:53,168
initiate AirPlay Mirroring to a
destination

770
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:57,134
so without further delay of the guys
come back up and show you a few things

771
00:43:58,034 --> 00:43:59,055
that I just talked about

772
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:02,108
and completing the the device duty cycle

773
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:06,037
so we go to the settings and we'll see
what we have

774
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:09,038
active up us manage settings from the
from

775
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:12,141
R&D answer to notice that to you don't
have a profiles

776
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:16,098
are setting under general anymore is
called device management

777
00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:19,192
if I just heard are regular
configuration profiles installed

778
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:23,098
this would be called profiles if I have
both

779
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:26,112
device management setting and profiles
and started called

780
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:30,086
device management and profiles so but
since we only have the Indian aroma

781
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:31,099
profile here

782
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:34,165
I'm going to conduct and as you notice
art this is no

783
00:44:35,065 --> 00:44:39,066
a non-renewable indium Indian profile

784
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:42,138
and you notice that every every single
profile that the the server has pushed

785
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:46,039
is no colour did into some sensible

786
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:49,116
category so we have restrictions they
can tell which restrictions have been

787
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:52,098
convicted by the server

788
00:44:52,098 --> 00:44:55,159
and we have applications that have been
installed here

789
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:59,116
and we have also accounts that have been
configured so we don't show the

790
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:01,058
individual profiles but

791
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:04,102
that actually configured these we just
call it all this information so that it

792
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,070
some more pretty accessible

793
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:10,071
and discoverable and in more details
attention we have better

794
00:45:11,034 --> 00:45:14,065
better information about certificates we
can actually see the fall

795
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:18,120
our signatures and %uh public you did up
so it's not just like dot dot dot

796
00:45:19,002 --> 00:45:22,055
and you can also have are information
about other

797
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:25,106
settings that come down and here we have
manage domains

798
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:30,045
so I'm gonna show you much demands how
those are working email

799
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:33,060
so we are in back

800
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:36,007
in Acme to private and I'm gonna start

801
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:40,045
are composing an email I'm gonna pick
our market and MADD com

802
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:45,037
and this is no market address us this is
not something that I should probably

803
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:46,053
send email to

804
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:51,061
so it's so its own marked as read if I
use a different address

805
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:54,065
use my me in private mail that's marked
us

806
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:57,073
a valid e-mail that meets our are

807
00:45:57,073 --> 00:46:00,128
you know a lot rules and this also
applies to my center console

808
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:05,042
since I have configured this device for
i Kant I also have my i card account

809
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:08,085
so my I quote account is also marked

810
00:46:08,085 --> 00:46:11,086
that's not something that I should be
sending met with

811
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:14,105
so to are managed a man's inside

812
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:18,026
now and

813
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,119
then we are basically done with the
device so know we can return this device

814
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:22,094
to service

815
00:46:22,094 --> 00:46:25,169
so the next year is gonna grab this
machine aren't worth much going to do

816
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:29,162
he's going to issue a erase command onto
the device

817
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:33,135
so basically the user has left the
company or perhaps I graduated from

818
00:46:34,035 --> 00:46:34,121
school

819
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:39,029
and magic happens no so we're gonna
unplug the device and look to a

820
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,054
different device

821
00:46:41,054 --> 00:46:44,070
so here we go

822
00:46:44,007 --> 00:46:47,021
and know we have just received the same
device

823
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:50,096
and we're back in the squad back in the
home screen I'm I'm going to

824
00:46:50,096 --> 00:46:53,151
us a new user I'm gonna walk through the
setup screens

825
00:46:54,051 --> 00:46:57,109
and configure this device third the
devices come back

826
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:02,014
for the duty cycle and I've got the
activation lock bypass code for this

827
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:02,113
device

828
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:06,028
and he's gonna walk through go ahead

829
00:47:06,028 --> 00:47:10,065
and and set up and when he encounters
the fact that it's locked

830
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:14,079
I'll be able to clear it and you'll be
able to actually finish activation

831
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,092
and continue on right so assumes the
post talks to be a couple services again

832
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:22,187
I'm I'm getting prompted for some random
Apple ID because the previews user

833
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,172
had enabled I quote even though this was
a supervised device we had a lot of

834
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:27,081
people to use

835
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:31,101
fight my Find My iPad and no I have no
idea

836
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:35,033
WordPress users account is so marc has
just issued

837
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:38,059
a activation luck unlock comment from

838
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:41,117
from profile manager and if I know go
back to

839
00:47:42,017 --> 00:47:46,058
the activation phase no I'm going to be
prompted to

840
00:47:46,058 --> 00:47:50,111
in rolling to my Indian server again
call acne help desk for any issues

841
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:54,025
and my next user is no going to get
prompted to

842
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:58,068
and to their password and read it to go
so that's the duty cycle over

843
00:47:58,068 --> 00:48:01,131
love using iPad's with Andy and to a
similar program

844

00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:29,122
documents the wrong email addresses we
also showed how to use the activation of

852
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:32,027
bypass code we captured when rolling
device

853
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:35,090
to you enable the device to be white and
returned to service

854
00:48:35,009 --> 00:48:39,033
by completing the cycle and again
getting that devices right device in on
