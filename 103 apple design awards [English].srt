1
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:15,050
and please welcome your hosts Sean
pruden

2
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:22,005
and Jon Garland see the good afternoon
and thank you for joining us

3
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:31,029
yet thanks for

4
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,097
for coming thru spend time with the into
this long day

5
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:37,206
it's a for many view

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,510
who are out there last night when I was
leaving the student event and put all

7
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:42,144
your chairs the got real cool

8
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:47,046
on the sidewalk I'm sure and you spent a
whole long night waiting for this day

9
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:50,503
in you been here and now you join us to
celebrate

10
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,730
them excellent house at your place
though award excellence in innovation on

11
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:57,078
both via Web and a with can

12
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:00,427
and every year it gets more and more
difficult to pick

13
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,134
are to find winners because there are so
many great our

14
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,370
yeah so many have you

15
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:11,058
we shared that they think this morning
that seventy percent of the audience

16
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:11,065
here

17
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:16,827
at WC are new to the show and so many
have you have never been to this shell

18
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,115
the design awards it so we've got pic we
take a moment to explain how we pick the

19
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,020
winners

20
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:26,086
how we we judge the winning aP's using
through three major

21
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,100
we judge if they're winning ups in three
major areas:

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,369
the first is around design so

23
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:38,450
for design we look at perhaps that or
we're looking perhaps the easy to use

24
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:42,354
I caps that are familiar that are
consistent within themselves but

25
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,990
consistent with the operating system as
well

26
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,132
they have a great game looks a really
excellent gameplay

27
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,050
their intuitive and understandable and
immediately usable by the people who

28
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:53,030
they were built for

29
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:57,103
and then we look at maps are in the
technology

30
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:01,012
we judge apt around technology so we're
were

31
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:04,962
evaluating the app's on their use a I
was through with 10 frameworks

32
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,850
to do really cool stuff for dad really I

33
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,164
really valuable functionality I or
looking

34
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:15,162
we're also looking at whether the app
launches quickly is it responsive

35
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:20,104
does it take a you know there's that
work the way you would expect it to work

36
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:24,012
and and are there you know our is their
smooth scrolling

37
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:27,091
I we look at whether or not the app runs
on the latest OS is

38
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:31,140
weather takes advantage of the newest
hardware and that takes advantage of

39
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,390
things like em 7 a.m.

40
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,045
a seven on i OS or multi-core other
technologies and hardware technologies

41
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:38,128
on OS 10

42
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:42,087
and then thirdly mmm we're looking at
ups

43
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:46,120
from the point of view innovation and
innovation really is that

44
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:50,007
that spark a brilliance rate that
uniqueness

45
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:54,051
the the clever implementation of
something that you wouldn't have

46
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:54,140
expected

47
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:59,031
in the first place but then when you see
it I your blown away by it

48
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:03,148
and and there's so many ways the talk
about innovation it really comes down to

49
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:07,089
the implementation of something that is
just so

50
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:11,142
crash and so are compelling and done in
a unique way

51
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:16,721
so those three areas are how we judge
the app's there's so many more things we

52
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:17,840
look at

53
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:20,179
but in a nutshell their their group in
those three in there was three years

54
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,115
so let's talk about the private the R
word winners

55
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:29,023
will be given to take home it's pretty
much wanna every piece of hardware that

56
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:29,098
we make

57
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:32,717
a Mac Pro with Retina Display a 27-inch
iMac

58
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,890
an Apple TV a MacBook Air and MacBook
Pro and iPad and iPod touch

59
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:41,092
not a bad haul

60
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:45,128
and

61
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:49,029
and last but not least probably the most
coveted

62
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:52,073
a party the award is yeah I get to take
home what are these

63
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:55,122
eighty a trophy cubes and a these

64
00:03:56,022 --> 00:04:00,023
are you know statically early detect
touch the touch-sensitive

65
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:03,502
see touch them they light up on the top

66
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,801
just like the backup your your MacBook
Pro the Apple logo light up

67
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,712
and I these are to die for must have

68
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,970
I Apple products and a few if you're
going to get one tonight

69
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:17,123
so without any further ado let that get
to the winners

70
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:22,032
we're gonna start with a few student
winners in

71
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:25,060
students have been part up w BBC for
many many years

72
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:29,032
in fact we have got a student
scholarship program were rewarded

73
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:33,152
200 students this year yeah 200 students
appear in the house

74
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:38,073
and your student scholarship winner this
we could you stand up for a moment we

75
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:39,129
just want to award you

76
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:47,029
with some recognition the

77
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,112
they fear

78
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:57,094
thank you would be litigated we're
delighted done some

79
00:04:57,094 --> 00:05:00,142
you guys have done some great work got
to get here and

80
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:04,046
the app's that we looked at were were
really impressive

81
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:07,098
and so you you deserve to be here

82
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,124
this week and we hope that you're gonna
continue to press a some incredible out

83
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:15,035
that put the more veteran developers
were in the audience

84
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:18,091
a you know give them a run for the money
right like the that

85
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,146
who have been like somebody that these
were a student winners that we

86
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,123
highlighted in previous years

87
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,114
we demo you're on stage some other maybe
have changed names or what-have-you but

88
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:29,055
they were great aP's

89
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:32,130
written by students over the past three
years so

90
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:38,015
let's move on to our first winner our
first winner

91
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:41,111
is panel perfect by have peeled and two
bros

92
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:49,011
winners we've come up but there are 150
here

93
00:05:56,075 --> 00:06:03,075
number here

94
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,215
gone

95
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,521
make fifty you again

96
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:17,130
graduation panel perfect is a fun and
simple way to share beautiful panoramic

97
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:19,016
photos these are two

98
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:22,136
former high school students but it ended
up with a beefy in 2012 instant

99
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:23,112
scholarship

100
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:27,105
I and built this out when they were
inspired by our own fix announcement

101
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:32,094
panoramic and John gonna show it now
yeah it's great stories in the you know

102
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:36,133
watching something and then deciding to
write an app up

103
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,030
I think that I got a great story so

104
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:44,100
had a perfect is this app that allows
you to view panoramic photos

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,199
and its a there's just the

106
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,690
are a community of people who love
panoramas that are

107
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,768
submitting up photos to the into the app
so the very familiar user interface

108
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,430
just rolling through this these guys are
using you like it dynamics an image

109
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:01,082
effects for blurs

110
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:04,431
on a on summer the UI which will get you
in a moment

111
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,250
so this not explore this is kinda
curated set panoramas

112
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:12,084
if we go to nearby the zinc or location
determine where you are

113
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:16,633
and that we're gonna go in here
hopefully unload some panels

114
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,280
yeah there's some panels that are nearby
couple imposed by the creators are the

115
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:22,099
up

116
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,998
but I let this go into this one we
double top you can favored it

117
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,080
you can like it you can comment on it
and then you can double top and just go

118
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:31,055
in

119
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:35,794
and gesture through Puri to go and look
at the entire panorama

120
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,300
and they're doing a lower res

121
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:43,005
thumbnails in the feed that you see here

122
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:47,441
and then they're going to the high res
for panoramas um when you go and look in

123
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,370
up to the individual up to the
individual image so

124
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,066
super cool app that really with was
created to address

125
00:07:55,066 --> 00:08:00,075
the experiences that at the time there
was no support for panoramic images in a

126
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,160
lot of social networking aP's

127
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:06,058
and so these guys stepped up and made
some really cool regulation natural can

128
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:06,707
have a car

129
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:14,229
he alright

130
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,697
the next app is up was created because

131
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,076
I'll them the incredible movement and
growth

132
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,900
iPad in education and a

133
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,051
you know people are changing iPad is
change the way that we're learning in

134
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:33,671
the classroom

135
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,570
changing the way that adults are
learning and kids are learning and that

136
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,081
the mix of iPad

137
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:41,083
in education is really taking off
because the

138
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:46,044
the incredible new aP's they're
available interactive textbooks

139
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:50,060
really tremendous content and other
creators of this next app

140
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:55,011
I solve that saw the growth that was
going on and also saw specific need that

141
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,101
they wanted to step up to

142
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:00,036
and and salt so our winner does that

143
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:07,036
and they are animal adventure by Keith
Lee

144
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:23,099
the

145
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,121
like

146
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,029
Graham played him

147
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:34,018
you're welcome animal adventure is a fun
and engaging

148
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,371
out the key to the single digit addition
money from here the area am

149
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,206
it was created by grad been from
Columbia University who are involved in

150
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:42,304
research in cognition

151
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:46,641
learning and the way kids learn and
technology sinister professor possum

152
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:47,290
have

153
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,110
the story tell from Otto and is building
a robot that could ruin the world

154
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:54,490
join the outermost to win back blocking
rebuild the Golden City to its former

155
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:54,637
glory

156
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:59,071
John right thing earlier this happened
so I'm not going to get into this

157
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,167
sinister I you know situation getting
that whole game play

158
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,912
but these folks worked with a from
Sesame Workshop

159
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:10,355
I am and to create some really great
artwork in the app

160
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:14,220
the app is focused on teaching children
basic addition

161
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:17,311
and a for a lot of kids this is a real
struggle and so

162
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,470
his the developer a set out to solve
this problem

163
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,336
so we're going to get into the app will
skip over the narrative at the beginning

164
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,760
here

165
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,790
is pretty straightforward stuff from
both your gonna get the answers right

166
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:35,238
without even yeah but I'm the key here
is that the app is teaching children

167
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,007
addition and when you're first morning
edition

168
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,582
wanna you just you know the first thing
you do is you cannot thinkers you just

169
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,360
kinda like 123 you count them off
individually install the app

170
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:49,205
let you do that and so I can just tap

171
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,578
you know I get five I get some be back
in the UI

172
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,098
I move the slider bar with the packed
I'll deal 25

173
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:00,818
and I get confirmation that it's the
right answer or I don't was wrong answer

174
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:06,720
I can also do count on just second
edition it also wants the child has

175
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,850
learned to basically count through the
numbers

176
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,684
you know are the numbers then they can
start moving onto

177
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,451
different times in addition where
they're gonna take a a big number and

178
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,661
add some smaller numbers to it so

179
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,230
in this case weekends with the child
gonna start to learn that you can start

180
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:21,912
with three

181
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:25,160
and then do one more get four right

182
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:29,895
they're getting in the app continues to
go on and teach all kinds of other tools

183
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,087
and techniques for learning

184
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,546
addition another one is doubles where
you're based we start off with a

185
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:39,834
I you know three and four seven and so
first the chosen you can cut before

186
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:44,330
in two or three into Creed 3 in 1870 ap
us for these kinds of techniques think

187
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,237
they can manage it by Wes technologies
to do a really great experience with

188
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:50,115
large text great colors

189
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,908
and an experience I think that is really
going to resonate with little kids

190
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:02,079
so congratulations extremely well done
thank you very much

191
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:17,088
can we get the flight back truck

192
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,017
there we are

193
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:28,113
alright everybody loves a great game and
there are so many games on the App Store

194
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,111
and we had with a lot of time looking
through

195
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:37,044
are the best games and try to figure out
which one was was the one that needed to

196
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:38,080
be a winner and there are many

197
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,083
that needed to be a winner on 42 we can
only award so many tonight

198
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:46,077
but one other types of gaming want to
take the games on the App Store this

199
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:47,084
super popular there really loves

200
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,070
that originated in the eighties is the
platformer

201
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:54,078
and I am and in the platformer game

202
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,123
us genre what you're doing is you're
you're basically you know running and

203
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,071
jumping moving in jumping

204
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,153
I to avoid obstacles and get coins and

205
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:07,066
say people and get money and you know
whatever you're getting

206
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,095
I am the whole point is to not fall off
the platform

207
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,142
right and i'd the way you fall off the
platform is you get

208
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:17,053
you know spear to you some of the ball
hits you were

209
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:20,057
something falls on you or whatever but
the point is that the platform is a

210
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:22,135
pretty loose term but you're moving
across this thing

211
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:27,041
and it just goes on and on and on in our
next winter

212
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:31,107
has created I think one of the most
incredible platformer games today on the

213
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:33,093
App Store their recent arrival

214
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:36,119
and and we're thrilled to wear them with
something today

215
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,022
to Leo's fortune from $13.37

216
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:47,049
memory

217
00:13:53,097 --> 00:14:00,097
and

218
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:04,032
run

219
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,081
going

220
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:08,470
correctly rather well I'm ratliff

221
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:15,047
naturally in Leo fortune you hunt down a
cunning and the Furious ball

222
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:20,570
the when you found your phone am for a

223
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:24,128
yeah i coming in the theory is Bobby
traveling through lush

224
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,040
environment such as mark the fourth air
desert snow-capped mountains

225
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:32,016
and pirate fiddy uncover the truth
behind Leo stolen fortune

226
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:35,061
great well I'm not gonna go

227
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:38,880
to the snow-capped peaks sir I'm
underwater anything like that I'm gonna

228
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:40,501
show you the basic gameplay

229
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,178
us did you get a sense for for what's
going on

230
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,860
I get the following brought down a
little bit that be great

231
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:52,185
alright so we'll support him I'll you've
got about twenty five levels are more

232
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,790
that you can just

233
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,318
swipe through in a very familiar user a
user interface

234
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,078
I'm a star level one because I wanna
point out something

235
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,531
that is such a great example of their
attention to detail

236
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,668
and the way that they've done things in
this game so I'm gonna start the

237
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:07,007
tutorial

238
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:11,750
and this is really for the on-boarding
experience for the app in there are so

239
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,124
many APs nowadays that are needing to do
this they want to get you

240
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:18,691
up up on you know into the app and the

241
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:22,430
help you understand how to use the app
and you don't need something that's very

242
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:23,317
high

243
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,931
you know that super intense but to do
this well

244
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,131
takes a lot of design and I think a lot
of thinking and

245
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,334
its owner she is so the game starts off
like this and the first thing you're

246
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:34,924
told is where to place your thumbs

247
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,856
in order to do that you're immediately
learning how to hold the iPad to play

248
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:39,607
the game

249
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:44,350
sign up on my left them here right I'm
here and now the game starts the work

250
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:47,214
and it's got these coach marks so I'm
gonna move the left thumb

251
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,860
we're gonna start the clock points with
with Leo here

252
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:53,092
okay so here's the platformer experience
right

253
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:56,261
you're driving along on this so-called
platform

254
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,092
and boom I'm stock I can't get over this
thing but this on morning experience has

255
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,412
these goes thing images

256
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:06,619
and they tell me that if I move my right
thumb up I can inflate Leo

257
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:10,687
and move him up and down on and now I'm
dealing with an obstacle in this case

258
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,372
but keep going thanks

259
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,115
hope some down there no problem I can go
back up

260
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,926
I can play no sorry all come on

261
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:29,291
I what's the problem with these demos
right okay here we go we land on their

262
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,790
room that our here we are we drive
around

263
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,478
enormous the just be a factor in the
background is this

264
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:39,197
there's this perspective going on you
got petals

265
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,351
flying through the air on other levels
there's rain falling there's

266
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,094
all kinda stuff happening in this this
is a in the distance

267
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,655
and here you're dealing with this
obstacle in the game with

268
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:53,345
all these kinds of obstacles were we all
have to solve is to do something in one

269
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:54,264
spot

270
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,772
to open a door are some kind of a bridge
in this case I landed on top I would I

271
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:02,930
and some just getting played him put
this around and then

272
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,312
move along and keep jumping and

273
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,520
this is just the real quick view of
what's going on in this game

274
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:13,061
we just thought they did such a good job
for example with this kind of a NASCAR

275
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:16,490
which is really hard to get you know to
do well

276
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,730
I'll you going down for mines your hand

277
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,912
in a rainstorms all kinda stuff and then
here

278
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,643
again this on boarding experience but
I'm actually playing at and you see that

279
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:29,720
i'm suppose the jump this guy

280
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:33,021
right film and then now I'm

281
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:37,700
long this is just the first level but
the game goes on and we just

282
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:41,058
really love this game for that attention
to detail across all the levels

283
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:46,730
for the great integration with touch for
the leveraging a by West technologies in

284
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:47,700
graphics

285
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,736
for the sound system there's so much
that these guided right

286
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,110
and before I say congratulations this is
an awesome app

287
00:17:55,011 --> 00:18:02,011
taken from

288
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:11,480
and right we all have busy lives

289
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,072
and one other things that that I've
learned over time and other people have

290
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:17,361
learned is that if you can capture

291
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:21,210
some other things that are going on and
take a moment to record

292
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:24,022
an idea a thought

293
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:28,591
a memory were something happens and it
triggers a thought you want to capture

294
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,230
that that that exercise

295
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:35,582
writing things down for a moment to just
capturing these little bit something

296
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,816
bits have above information throughout
the day

297
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,131
is actually a great way to relieve
stress it's actually a great way to

298
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,780
build memories and in kind of

299
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,800
catalog your day it can also be you know
I

300
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:51,965
idea incubator and so this is something
it's a good discipline for us all to get

301
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:52,990
into

302
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:55,198
in this developer the developer the next
up the next winter

303
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,887
totally understand this idea and they
are

304
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:07,769
Bloomville who've made day one

305
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,074
hamlet way

306
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:33,074
hamlet play

307
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,085
happily them

308
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:45,960
grappling day one lets you record your
life

309
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:48,119
as you live it from every day moment for
once in a lifetime event

310
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,088
the elegant interface a gay one makes
journal in your life

311
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,325
a simple pleasure rights with the backup

312
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,940
it's also available i OS up as well

313
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:05,158
are but we thought we would awarded for
the Mac can show it off on the Mac

314
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,420
because so many of us are so busy and
developers

315
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:11,450
our max everyday write code we're
spending time

316
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:15,133
and in Xcode or we're doing using
various tools he could be a spreadsheet

317
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:19,982
you could be writing some serve a
document up but along the way

318
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,440
something what happened you like your
phone call I thought pops into mind

319
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:27,783
an email arrives and you might wanna
record an idea or put something quickly

320
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,940
down which is a big part of journaling
not sitting down to write something huge

321
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:32,883
it's just capturing these little nuggets

322
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:36,760
and so day one test builds a little

323
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,051
menu extra you can type in and put some
sort of entry an indictable straight in

324
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:41,166
the log in then

325
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:44,924
into the into the Journal and then
you're back to your

326
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:48,720
are or we could just go up here and
we'll just launch the app

327
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:51,091
and I'll we can a

328
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:55,741
inside the app immediately create
journal entries so I can say

329
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,940
you know here I am at a couple

330
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:01,433
sign words sorry

331
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,284
the trophies or

332
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:08,950
great want one

333
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:11,554
things so right

334
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:15,478
there's my entry I can take turns out
attacks took a trophy

335
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:20,690
picture earlier so I can take this
picture dropping into here and a once

336
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:22,548
get it either take the date for the
picture just say

337
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,255
leave it unchanged based on the daytime
entering this journal entry and

338
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:30,081
and I think I'm done I can tag it with
various tags that are in the system

339
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,632
I can add a location that got Maps
integration like it to use current

340
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,405
location about like

341
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:39,715
and I'm done and there's the entry in
there and I can look at my journal

342
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:45,452
overtime using the the overall view up
all the journal entries and so here's

343
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,961
just a sample Journal

344
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:50,272
thats that we've got in the in the app
here

345
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:54,558
where you can take a look at all these
entries um and go back in time and

346
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:58,335
and see what's going on and really that
is the whole point of journaling is

347
00:21:58,929 --> 00:21:59,984
capturing these moments

348
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:04,561
in time as they occur at the pop in your
mind and we felt that they won

349
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:10,190
did such a great job at this as well
they've got built in notifications you

350
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,678
can set up reminders to

351
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:16,190
to put things into your journal they've
got inspirational quotes that will pop

352
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:18,118
up when you're gonna create a journal
entry

353
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:22,303
they can be inspiring and get your
writing and really that's the essence of

354
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,470
a great tool right is that it it gets
the job done

355
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:30,126
it doesn't get in the way and it's
perfectly balanced and we selected this

356
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,220
tool for being super well design an OS
10

357
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:36,331
and in being exactly what it needs to be

358
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,710
and nothing more so congratulations on a
job well done

359
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:46,071
here

360
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:54,950
alright

361
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:57,108
our next winter is a

362
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:02,026
it's just such a great example love the
above the principal

363
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:05,325
%uh minimalist design you know design is
all about

364
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,633
of it and finish it's all about the
marriage between form and function

365
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,210
it's about are you know communicating
clearly

366
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:17,115
and and I West really

367
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:22,021
helps you to do this right by helping
you focus on content

368
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:25,080
arm I getting out of the way

369
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:29,089
giving you a a system that allows you to
draw

370
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,108
you know the the you like my with seven
that is

371
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:38,071
that is minimalist in nature and and you
know it takes a lot of attention

372
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:42,152
and a lot of focus and refinements to
actually end up with something that is

373
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:48,074
that is in its purest form that is
something that's that is exactly what

374
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:50,753
you wanted to be in nothing more there's
no extra dormant

375
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,710
and our next winner did that with their
game and they are

376
00:23:55,071 --> 00:24:02,071
black by cannot be brother them

377
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,744
home Bradley

378
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,400
the goal in this game

379
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:23,083
to shape a line for all the colored
circle for while avoiding black hole

380
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:28,051
a long and proud from delightfully
simple to exceptionally deep and complex

381
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:33,088
it's a stroke of genius John you have
this app is

382
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:37,125
a is awesome and I wanna just to give
you not believe this game you need to

383
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:39,046
see it from the start

384
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:42,765
so the basic point the game is you know
I Sean said you

385
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,490
you gesture and you draw the line I

386
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:49,115
to knock out the colored dots and when
you get to a level where they're black

387
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:51,083
dots you want to avoid those

388
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:55,125
but you know it the first level you're
just the starting of here with this

389
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:56,934
gesture

390
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,780
and you know notices I'm playing here
that there is no

391
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:06,227
there's nothing extra on-screen it's
just the dots it's just my gesture

392
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:11,530
and the gesture the rendering of the
gesture is is almost like calligraphy a

393
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:11,122
minute just

394
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:15,061
the it it has a flair to it it's got

395
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:19,088
its representative at the speed up my
stroke the exact timing

396
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:22,164
the the link that everything so eager to
these three

397
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,115
so those are easy levels let me jump up
to

398
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:30,034
up to level eight here for a moment
which is kinda fun

399
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:34,483
so here I got an instance where I've got
to avoid the black dots but get the

400
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:35,350
white ones

401
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,084
are get the colored ones and and to do
that I've gotta figure out what gesture

402
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:39,653
to do that we'll repeat

403
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:44,210
across the screen through these colored
up no

404
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:47,720
the other thing that's super cool what
this app is that it leverages audio

405
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:52,480
other for for great feedback and so this
a very fun

406
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:56,497
lightweight a you know sounds that come
through as you screw up basically

407
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:03,929
so from with yep

408
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:07,870
you know so you're messing up when he
tried by right

409
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:11,148
knock-knock way not quite

410
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:16,377
Jill not quite anything about this

411
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,150
it's like that you like I'll black in
the sound is

412
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:24,020
with great feedback well after I all

413
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:27,971
now mind john all

414
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:33,100
naw I'm left but it would give up

415
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:36,042
but would be this a thoroughly the
Devils

416
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:39,146
yeah we love it game for the minimalist
design the great integration with the

417
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:40,109
touch

418
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:45,014
a you know system %uh ViaWest just that
expression

419
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:48,053
I'll I'll such as the great engagement

420
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,860
it's great expression at the game in a
very simplistic way

421
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:55,139
with no extra dormant and it so
congratulations on actual job

422
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:03,039
very much what the

423
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:08,060
may

424
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:12,397
play there right the hope

425
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:15,990
you know we were all

426
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,182
you know at the conference this weekend
we're crazy busy you've got a hundred

427
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:20,147
and what is it 10 fashions to attend and

428
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:24,065
so this is just a great example love how
busy we are

429
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:27,107
I for not a conference you guys are
writing code

430
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:31,023
you go to school you're doing you're
doing light and

431
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:35,028
and if you're anything like me you know
that it's hard to keep on top I love

432
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:38,128
all the things that are going on in the
world around us whether it's in our

433
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:39,807
industry

434
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,010
whether it's a not enter through enters
in our industry but something that

435
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,096
interests of whether it's sports or
world news or what have you

436
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:50,545
and so we've got News you know it's not
look for lack of news sources it's just

437
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:53,330
that there's so much news coming out

438
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:56,102
and it's often hard to pick

439
00:27:57,002 --> 00:28:00,038
a quality sources news it's hard to

440
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:03,567
to find one that is you know curated

441
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:07,130
and that's gonna give you what you are
really interested in

442
00:28:07,013 --> 00:28:10,040
in the link that you wanted to be in and

443
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:13,393
more importantly it's even hard to find
time to read it all

444
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:18,790
and the developer over next stop the
next stop the winner is

445
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,870
set out to solve this dilemma up getting
information to people

446
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:25,108
in a timely manner in a way that they
can consume it easily

447
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:33,008
and our winner is Yahoo news digest by
Yahoo

448
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:00,870
rightfully unfair

00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:03,178
now out I'm got playing

450
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:08,172

00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:40,078
stories in them in the morning at 8 a.m.
and

459
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,085
at 6 p.m. in the evening and that's it

460
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:46,130
and so this is what time I go to New
zaps all the time

461
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:50,015
I wait for these I just arrived and once
they arrive

462
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:53,086
you can just scroll through on

463
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:57,134
this really simple you why that lists
the stories the top stories in the day

464
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:01,039
and what they've done really well as
they've

465
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,071
you know done this automatic collection
of information and aggregation and

466
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,159
all the work that they do behind the
scenes with some Lee but then they're

467
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:10,077
doing human curation at the content

468
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:13,108
in addition with the editors and so the
car could be you get

469
00:30:14,008 --> 00:30:17,077
the news stories are extremely a

470
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:20,120
extremely high quality so here we are
we're moving through

471
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:26,068
%uh this list in CC Paul political story
there's a US news story technology world

472
00:30:26,086 --> 00:30:29,127
below into the story headlined you've
got um

473
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:33,059
you've got these little Adams is all
circles

474
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,071
and you can tap them to get the legend
of what you to these mean

475
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:39,083
basically they're telling you how much
information there is available for one

476
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:39,148
other stories

477
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:43,051
the so let's go into the story but I'll
a wanna

478
00:30:43,078 --> 00:30:47,113
and you the first time you use it it
says how to use the app and see you can

479
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:48,070
swipe

480
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:51,014
just right to left around the stories

481
00:30:51,077 --> 00:30:54,080
or go back into a story and redid up

482
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:58,083
read it in more detail and I find that
these are you know if I just take about

483
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,092
10 minutes to plow through this I guess

484
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,187
I've got of some great information about
the latest headlines

485
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:07,176
and so you get these great call outs you
moving through the story that's pretty

486
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:08,134
much it

487
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,096
it's well laid-out at the bottom you're
getting extra information like

488
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,195
up photos that may be associated with
the story they're coming from really

489
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:15,189
good sources

490
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:20,089
there might be a topic breakdown there
might be a video that loads very very

491
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:20,160
quickly that

492
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:24,072
it's a a quick summary of up the story
others maps

493
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:28,695
integration if it if it's appropriate
and then you can go through

494
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,140
some top tweets I'll or other social
networking posts that

495
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:38,062
that apply to this story and and so
that's how we to the stories is laid out

496
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,070
and he just looked through them one by
one and read them

497
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:44,045
some really great visual effects in a
kind of a plea for you why

498
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:49,064
in the app another example playful you I
is the share button these guys kinda pop

499
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:50,603
up from the bottom they kinda

500
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,310
down some go away um so

501
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:57,078
really great experience and then when
you're done I love the

502
00:31:57,078 --> 00:32:02,083
the what they've done Spears have a good
time I love would be done at the very

503
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:02,182
end because

504
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:06,083
you read through this in the news is
really great but its they've done a

505
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,183
great job with Kenny just came up buying
that's a little bit

506
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:12,157
by giving you feedback on how many the
story they just saying that you read

507
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:16,109
and so while we dislike through them now
it doesn't mean we read them but

508
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:21,023
impure you've read them in and at the
end you just get old hey we're at 7.9

509
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,051
and that its I just find it kinda cool

510
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:28,097
the feedback now the this digest that
we're looking at right here the black

511
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:29,162
background because it's the

512
00:32:30,062 --> 00:32:33,110
the other day digest but working top the
top right corner

513
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,100
see that the next hour next I just as
coming in 11 hours by top the center the

514
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:38,838
screen it says

515
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:42,380
up patience is a virtue love that the
first time I saw that

516
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:45,126
and I can go back across the last week
and pick one

517
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:49,105
a maybe a died just that I haven't read
saw a pic a morning digest:

518
00:32:50,005 --> 00:32:54,036
and here the news comes in and it's the
white background

519
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:58,037
so little bit of attention to detail
little attention to detail

520
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:01,047
on things like white background for Dane
is

521
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:04,126
black background for night time that
news I just very playful interface

522

many developers

528
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:46,350

but the need to create something that is

529
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:49,057
that is really great it's that is truly

530
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:52,726
impactful in people's lives and what are
the ways to create

531
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:58,283
a really great game is a porous to use
technology have a great game loop have a

532
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,350
great you know

533
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:03,334
game mechanic et cetera but more
important than any of that

534
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:08,740
is to add personality to a game that's
what makes an engaging

535
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:11,903
thats would makes a connection with
people and some other

541
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:31,743
had really great personality very unique
to their game

542
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,980
and this next game does everything right

543
00:34:35,098 --> 00:34:39,277
in addition to also adding personality
to the game and so

544
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,211
we're pleased to award a nata to 3

545

567
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:17,122
you can see on the part of the files
that there you know these two eyes and

568
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,094
nose or mouth the

569
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:23,108
the tiles or constantly in their blink

and in you know across all credit
markets whether professional or consumer

592
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:58,094
a you know in the creative space it's
pretty much always been the case

593
00:37:58,094 --> 00:38:01,133
that the best stops are first on the Mac

594
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:05,106
or their Mac only and our winner in this

595
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:09,045
our next winter %uh stays in this
tradition

596
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:12,714
and and we'd like to award an ATA
tonight to

597
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:20,119
in a graft probe i click for photo
cinema craft bro

598
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:39,058
broccoli

599
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:43,155
correctly than a graph pro is a
professional tool that allows you to

600
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,083
create living photos

601
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:49,101
with its unique live mapping technology
allows artists to preview their images

602
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:51,015
in real time

603
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:54,049
and it creates ultra high-definition
output if you're hyper

604
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:59,140
photo right so

605
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,103
first thing is you know we all know how
compelling video is

606
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,084
and we see video on the web up for
advertisements or for

607
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:10,128
you know merchandising or in catalogs or
whatever I

608
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:14,049
for things that we might be interested
in we wanna know about

609
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:17,106
and videos really great the problem
video is it hard to make

610
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:22,074
and it you know that a big footprint
it's got to be brought down

611
00:39:22,074 --> 00:39:25,090
it takes band with and so arm

612
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:28,022
you know there's a better way to do this
as far as these guys are concerned they

613
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:31,079
built this tool that optimize to create
something

614
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,145
they're calling portals for cinema
graphs which are basically living images

615
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:39,123
there a combination of a photo in a
video and

616
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:43,084
they benefit from being a whole lot more
lightweight then

617
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:46,086
video and a lot more interesting and
compelling

618
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:50,053
then photos to still photos so

619
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:53,127
arm but i wanna do here is show you
first the mall

620
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:57,044
just an animated a gear gyps re:

621
00:39:57,044 --> 00:40:00,122
Amager that I'm gonna create in a moment
and

622
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:04,078
now this is sort of an old file format
on the web but it still prevalent

623
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:07,079
and that to create one these is is
difficult

624
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:10,130
up to do we're going to do a minute and
so here's an imager

625
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:14,042
and we're gonna end up with that in that
started with this

626
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:17,076
this raw video:

627
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,938
so this is just video taken at Subway in
New York

628
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:25,303
and we're gonna start with that in
quickly in a cup in like three steps

629
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:25,504
create

630
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:29,180
a be an Egyptian create a flex also

631
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:32,650
a me switch over to sell a graph pro

632
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:35,164
now what you do is you open up the the
raw

633
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:40,660
video that you've got and a in this case
we got somebody walking by on the left

634
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,945
that we've got the train coming in

635
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,565
are here if you just look to the left to
the escalator you'll see as the sloops

636
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:50,801
the train's pulling in and that there's
the light and it stops right so it's a

637
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:51,900
very short clip

638
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:54,188
but we don't want any that noise in the
side we don't want any the reflection

639
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,097
from the lights and in different things
that are in the station on the walls

640
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:01,260
and so we start in the topic or we
choose tram

641
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,640
we pull in the tram and we figure out
exactly

642
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:07,903
you notice the lady on the left we
decide where we want her to freeze

643
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:11,542
in the image that we're gonna create or
in the in the cinema grab the run a

644
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:14,171
great we stop it there with the left
side of the tram

645
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:17,752
the right to the tram I'm just gonna
pull in here

646
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,995
and adjust just slightly so I get the
light from the train coming into the

647
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:22,378
left to the escalator their EC that

648
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:26,002
their in there so I just pulling in for
the right side

649
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:29,902
and the next is where the magic happens
I'm gonna go to the masked all

650
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:33,473
a lil bit too big hear someone who just
its size go down

651
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:36,887
and I'm gonna mask up the portion

652
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:42,070
love the image that the video that I
want to keep everything else now becomes

653
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:46,312
up up basically mapped out and then I'm
gonna go to

654
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:49,861
loop decide what kind of a looper good
several types the loop so they can do

655
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:53,534
I'll just stick with repeat a I'm in it
you know

656
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:57,817
leave the speed the way it is a leave
the lay the wait isn't just increase

657
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:00,346
CrossFit CrossFit is what happens when
the video

658
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,134
and and then it looks back to the
beginning soldiers make that smooth

659
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:09,013
looks like a continuous movement of the
escalator and lastly will go to

660
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:12,263
I look a quick lead adjustments I can
adjust all kinds a

661
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:16,900
the the attributes on this video but
I'll just go to the can defects that are

662
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:16,082
here

663
00:42:17,063 --> 00:42:21,262
and you can see that you can apply these
super quickly up to this

664
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,874
to this image and so let's grab a

665
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:28,313
black and white called Sun and then
we'll do

666
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:31,683
a render and we can save note is h264

667
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:35,266
or progress up 42 so we'll do that

668
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:38,960
save it to the desktop let's call it

669
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:45,052
demo and what's creating now is it's
creating this flexible file this

670
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:48,804
us in my graph that the folks at the
murder a pro

671
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:52,331
are three portal can host on their
servers for you

672
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,625
and it's super lightweight comes down
works with every browser

673
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,752
and is I gives you that exact experience

674
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:04,461
and so the end result is on is basically
this

675
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:07,931
we did you know you can see in the woman
on the left is frozen everything about

676
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:08,977
the scene is frozen

677
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:13,231
except the one piece that we want we did
this in three simple steps

678
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:17,290
this app is brand new on the Mac App
Store

679
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:22,650
its super gorgeous its really
streamlined it does one thing extremely

680
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:22,664
well

681
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:27,250
saving in 30 steps and other tools and I
they have a really great

682
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:30,268
up a model for hosting these things and
serving them out your site

683
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,167
and we just love this app it makes a Mac
Pro think so

684
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:41,959
really well done work thank you

685
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:51,660
alright we

686
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:54,755
talk about a moment ago about how great
app her personality

687
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:59,424
I and earlier on I talked about how we
judge the app's

688
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:04,163
up for the ADA talk about design we talk
about technology doppler we evaluate our

689
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:05,650
technology

690
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:09,154
adoption we evaluate on innovation and
we all know that

691
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:13,796
grade up sir also innovative and you
know innovation is hard to define

692
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:17,980
but it's for that that spark a
brilliance it's that

693
00:44:17,098 --> 00:44:22,147
I that ingredient that if an app has it
it just makes your job drop

694
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:26,032
right it's a its it's the kind of thing
that makes

695
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:30,380
a category you know appear out of
nowhere greater category defining aP's

696
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:31,670
that are innovative

697
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:36,114
there they do something clever arm and
you know you really know when you see it

698
00:44:37,014 --> 00:44:40,020
and we've all run across innovative aP's

699
00:44:40,002 --> 00:44:44,341
and we've we've run across one for the
ADA this year that we thought was

700
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:48,543
that was just over the top in terms of
about just approaching

701
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:51,660
this game situation in a very clever way

702
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:58,066
our next winner if the by pic by Fino go

703
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:25,041
use time make a tie device sick

704
00:45:26,036 --> 00:45:30,112
play for the convention obtain and
literature a captivating thriller which

705
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:31,100
the written word

706
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,026
if both your map as well as your
narrator and trying

707
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:39,027
story with puzzle and I blending pub
with no Bella

708
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:42,036
it draws the players into an intriguing
mystery governor of science and

709
00:45:42,036 --> 00:45:48,063
technology

710
00:45:48,063 --> 00:45:50,072
right

711
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:53,161
when I'm in landscape mode

712
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:57,950
I just bear with me here for landscape
mode

713
00:45:57,095 --> 00:46:00,192
you're holding the iPad this is a
narrative that you're reading through to

714
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,139
book the you read through

715
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,088
and we're starting to have happily three
the first chapter

716
00:46:06,088 --> 00:46:10,101
but as you move here you can see this
parallax effect behind these images

717
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:15,028
yeah and that is pervasive through the
app

718
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:19,074
I but not only is are the words on
screen

719
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:22,078
things that you really need to tell you
the story um

720
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:26,018
but you're also going to get clues about
the puzzle you up

721
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:30,020
call because fundamentally this is a
game but it's a combination of whole

722
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:30,651
game

723
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:34,020
and that's the you're reading along
you're looking at these photos

724
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:37,023
they do really interesting interactions

725
00:46:37,023 --> 00:46:41,068
and are they have a great sound system
built in so sometimes

726
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:45,140
new approach sounds in your your um know
they become louder and software is your

727
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:46,066
near them

728
00:46:47,002 --> 00:46:50,811
here we've run into an interactive a you
know an interactive piece

729
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:53,856
which at the moment doesn't do anything
but we're gonna need it at some point to

730
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:55,140
solve the puzzle

731
00:46:55,014 --> 00:46:59,403
and we move on here and you'll see that
you know while I'm reading this text

732
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:02,583
the text is actually doing all kinds of
interesting things are moving along

733
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:05,145
don't worry about the fact that sport
right up there because

734
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:08,831
we're gonna go in different directions
here in a moment and you see that

735
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:12,770
under strong left but the text is
actually moving things

736
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:15,119
here I get to the third floor study I
keep going

737
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:20,118
and here I got a device that I can
interact with you know

738
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:23,940
Piper combo in or something I keep going
here

739
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:26,117
and now I've got a choice I could go up
or down I'm gonna keep going here a

740
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:28,636
little bit and now we're certainly get

741
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:31,930
to a point where we have to rotate the
device or

742
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:34,120
and now for you guys will be able to
read it no problem

743
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:38,131
now I'm approaching a sore throat sound
key

744
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:43,150
frames number in the room where a great

745
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:46,067
media no enough room well

746
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:49,186
I will leave that behind we go here

747
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:54,230
at the turn the device this way to read
gotta turn the device this way

748
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:59,322
person throwing up our projection I am
of there we passed that now we're going

749
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:01,770
here we're going this way we're reading
the text

750
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:06,856
now we're going to put this way and in
essentially the entire game

751
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:13,640
is you're moving into a dining hall

752
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:17,137
I

753
00:48:18,037 --> 00:48:20,132
not gonna get authorization

754
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:24,040
on in what is

755
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:27,087
so innovative what this game is just
this combination up no

756
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:31,030
novel with game with puzzle interest the

757
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:34,094
you're constantly wrote in your device

758
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:38,100
tapping pinching zooming moving around
reading this story trying to figure it

759
00:48:39,054 --> 00:48:39,103
out

760
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:43,089
and we've never seen anything like this
really and out so

761
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:48,105
great job congratulations have brought
about by

762
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:56,005
here

763
00:48:59,529 --> 00:49:01,593
talk a little bit before about how we're
so busy that

764
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:05,228
getting news in a in a adjustable format

765
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:09,812
was at the Lima and the folks from Yahoo
News I just solve that problem

766
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:14,320
but you know there's also something else
that we're all doing

767
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:17,670
every day and that is sharing these
tidbits from our

768
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:21,400
from our lives with family with friends
with the world

769
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:25,308
if you hear WC in tell the world about
what's going on

770
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,155
but as interesting invaluable as these
tidbits are

771
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:34,569
they don't I don't think the replace

772
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:37,617
the need for sometimes telling a much
longer story

773
00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:41,123
much more visual story that captures

774
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:44,837
arm an emotion and something much deeper
than

775
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:49,328
any tweet or any you know Facebook post
or any other social media posts could

776
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:52,951
could do and our next winner is an app
that allows

777
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:56,857
for that paper rich storytelling and it
is storehouse

778
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:04,559
visual storytelling by for her media

779
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,500
gradually wrestling

780
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:40,050
instantly travel the world

781
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:43,234
learn a new skill or discover
interesting people argued for the story

782
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:45,760
created by the store have community

783
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:49,415
or you can simply put together photos
videos and text to build your own story

784
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:57,099
and you don't have to be a designer to
put together something stunning alright

785
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,920
like a

786
00:50:58,092 --> 00:51:02,144
like all over winners tonight this app
was designed no optimally designed for

787
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:06,045
the device it's running on for iPad for
iPhone for

788
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:09,364
for West Ham I and didn't nap

789
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:13,200
is the storytelling up it's built
exclusively for iPad

790
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:16,049
and the stories are told using photos
and video

791
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:19,075
and so what you do is in in their
contributed by

792
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,146
the community of story a storehouse arm
users

793
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,069

can flip through

797
00:51:36,022 --> 00:51:40,661
these books are the stories that have
been pushed out into the app

798
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:45,250
i think im gettin video and audio I'm so

801
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:53,116
and we gesture through any good to see

803
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:01,490
look at these photos you can apply

really they just a bowl and and easy to
to

808
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:17,402
to consume and then laying out text on
it is super easy

809
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:20,871
you ain't so when you're done with the
with the story could just pinch to get

810
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:21,701
outta bed

811
00:52:22,529 --> 00:52:26,660
other using you know you I packed sand
you I dynamics and

812
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:29,143
stop for the transitions I'm let me go
into one that's got

813
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:33,094
some videos so it's going to this story
by photojournalist

814
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:36,099
who went to rwanda um and so

815
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:39,192
this one's got in a much larger photos a
lot more tact

816
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:43,167

video the embedded radio and you don't
have to tap to start playing the video

818
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:52,460

majority vote on screen

819
00:52:52,046 --> 00:52:56,143
rape you keep reading again it's a much
more significant

820
00:52:57,043 --> 00:53:00,090
deeper more emotional story that's being
told here rain

821
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:04,035
and so these are being created by Sheps

822
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:08,405
fashion designers by photojournalists
around the world

823
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:11,621
and in families are creating them a
individuals are creating them so

824
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:15,327
one other want things about this app is

825
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:19,700
on it it lets you create ones books
through the story sorry

826
00:53:19,007 --> 00:53:22,079
super easily so just tap the Create
button we were at

827
00:53:23,042 --> 00:53:26,141
from the photo library let's say we went
to up

828
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,740
the lake we import these the is 14
images

829
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:33,433
and immediately they're laid out in in
the format

830
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:37,230
up that the upper right so what's a

831
00:53:37,023 --> 00:53:40,038
you know trip to

832
00:53:40,038 --> 00:53:45,040
Lake on great memories

833
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,037
and

834
00:53:48,073 --> 00:53:51,362
we sit down on that okay so now we're
down in

835
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:55,410
these in the basic you which is
thumbnail view but

836
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,890
it's like I wanna do more than that I
wanna make something compelling like the

837
00:53:58,259 --> 00:53:59,317
chicago won I saw a moment ago

838
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,680
so that they won't you know what that
this this image hereof the but the

839
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:05,139
cyclists is pretty cool so we just
happen drag

840
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:09,258
make that larger this one of her on the
on the

841
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:13,440
tree stump is pretty cool so we can just
happened right that we can double top

842
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:16,673
and and you know and property in the way
we want

843
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:21,124
go around make something really big like
this everything else moves are the way

844
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:25,640
great feedback through animation up and
you can just go on and on and you can

845
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,130
add the text you can create the brakes
you want to

846
00:54:28,013 --> 00:54:31,412
and then you can publish this out to the
store oath a community

847
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:34,555
and people are following you they're
gonna see I your story

848
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:37,880
up in this case I'm just gonna save it
as a draft but

849
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:41,077
is just such a compelling up just to
browse through the stories

850
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:44,894
and and see what people are posting a

851
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,690
in there for more significant and more
meaningful and more emotionally

852
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:51,448
a charge then just something small that
we would put out to the world which is

853
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:54,069
equally valuable but very different so

854
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:58,093
great adopted by was technologies thanks
for making something exclusive right had

855
00:54:58,309 --> 00:54:59,313
that is so compelling

856
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:06,349
guide

857
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:14,421
now

858
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:17,664
a people have been captivated for you
know

859
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:22,000
all-time pretty much by the night sky

860
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,599
I mean who hasn't sat out you know

861
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,630
are on a campground with friends the
back of a truck

862
00:55:29,063 --> 00:55:32,282
on a country road somewhere looking up
at the night sky watching

863
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:36,430
you know airplane lights watching
satellite passover

864
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:40,702
identifying are you know constellations
we're trying to

865
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:45,290
arm you're pointing out things that are
better-known like the Big Dipper the

866
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:46,095
North Star something like that

867
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:49,444
we've all done that we've all been
captivated by that

868
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:55,010
and it's certainly a very humbling and
in powerful experience the see the night

869
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:55,053
sky

870
00:55:55,053 --> 00:55:59,148
and the developer for next winter eyes
created an app that takes that to a

871
00:56:00,048 --> 00:56:01,052
whole new level

872
00:56:01,052 --> 00:56:08,052
and it is guy guide by fifty star lab

873
00:56:15,062 --> 00:56:22,062
you

874
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:29,095
in preparation discovering what's in the
night sky

875
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:33,154
effort life with guy guide you can
search for 1000 the celestial objects

876
00:56:34,054 --> 00:56:36,122
and simply follow the arrow in the sky
above you to feed them

877
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:40,086
and sky god works offline you can take
it with you anywhere

878
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:44,142
I'll take a look at the

879
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:48,044
a look at the lease is up you know first
and foremost the app

880
00:56:48,062 --> 00:56:51,120
a just as everything right technically

881
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:55,098
it is optimized you know to the nth
degree

882
00:56:56,016 --> 00:57:01,054
they're using OpenGL ES 3 they're using
knock or audio

883
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:04,065
their up you know leveraging all

884
00:57:04,065 --> 00:57:07,103
technologies that are appropriate
relevant for this up and and

885
00:57:08,003 --> 00:57:12,087
the performances to stunning one of the
first things you notice in the apt to

886
00:57:12,087 --> 00:57:15,128
and you're hearing it now is this
justice this ambient music that's

887
00:57:16,028 --> 00:57:17,071
playing in the background

888
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:20,132
other composer the music was on the same

889
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:25,111
think I have composed the sounds for
inet a winner of a couple years ago

890
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:29,012
called osmose great game um

891
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:34,033
in this this soundtrack here this for
this game is just so compelling

892
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:38,046
so as you're in this you can just you
know top around and look at the night

893
00:57:38,046 --> 00:57:38,111
sky

894
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:42,096
it automatically is showing you the
various constellations

895
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:44,152
I can top on

896
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:49,077
stars and I'm not stop talking for men
is it up on the start small stars

897
00:57:49,077 --> 00:57:50,080
produce a small

898
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,032
sound larger stars produce a large down
but just

899
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:57,333
you tap around you can almost make your
own music is your as you're just

900
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:04,369
experiencing this

901
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:16,079
I'm you can you can lift it up because
the short as the court would like to do

902
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:16,125
that

903
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:20,062
in top lift up missing is that the tax
you're looking at the sky it turns

904
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:24,065
it activates the compass in gyroscope
and snaking pan around

905
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:28,073
the sky above us in around us um in this
case I'm just gonna

906
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:31,105
go search for something that we all are
familiar with which is the

907
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:37,007
space station and

908
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:40,026
it you know you thought pointing to
we're going in now you can see the

909
00:58:40,026 --> 00:58:41,087
trajectory the space station

910
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:44,104
a which is pretty cool I can zoom in on
stuff

911
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:48,022
I won't be able to see it in great
detail Americans

912
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:51,107
you know pretty small on let's go back
out here

913
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:55,013
and look at different for the

914
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:58,077
the night sky when things you can do is
you can just because the

915
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:01,156
the noise that the light pollution that
surround us when we're outside

916
00:59:02,056 --> 00:59:05,060
you can actually just top two fingers on
screen

917
00:59:05,006 --> 00:59:08,015
and drag upper down to adjust

918
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:11,100
the amount of stars on screen on the on
in style guide

919
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,049
relative to what you're seeing you know
when you're out when you're outside

920
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:19,067
so that's kinda cool so it's it's it's a
good match it also

921
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:22,113
learn a lot about the night sky by
leveraging at all

922
00:59:23,013 --> 00:59:26,100
inside the app and this is the loop so
this lets you see

923
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,032
a difference spectra up beyond what's
visible to the human eye

924
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:34,043
and so you just bring up the slope you
can drag it around this guy

925
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:38,065
but he did take this and move through

926
00:59:38,065 --> 00:59:41,100
you know microwave infrared HL up

927
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,024
and you can leave it there and simply
move around

928
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:48,075
the night sky and look at different
things that are going on that

929
00:59:48,075 --> 00:59:51,110
you wouldn't know about but might be
behind one of your most being you know

930
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:55,024
most-favored constellations or something
um

931
00:59:55,033 --> 00:59:59,095
if I tap on an individual item I get
this blog I am the side here you'll see

932
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,114
it on the right side there

933
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,039
its its blinking to say you know look at
me

934
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:08,056
and I can read three information about
the object serious in this case that I

935
01:00:08,056 --> 01:00:08,129
selected

936
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:12,064
I can top something like anna's minor it
will go to that

937
01:00:12,064 --> 01:00:17,068
a I can tap the name over another
all-star and it'll go there

938
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:21,061
untapped the Sun and it will rotate to
the Sun so

939
01:00:21,061 --> 01:00:25,064
you know this is just scratching the
surface in this %ah it think rental

940
01:00:25,064 --> 01:00:29,118
the attention to detail these guys put
into it the optimization fry Wes

941
01:00:30,018 --> 01:00:33,094
on the soundtrack it's just a pleasure
to use this app

942
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:37,100
and I think it's at the standard that
that all over should aspire to

943
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,009
in our particular individual categories
so thank you for great work

944
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:49,009
place

945
01:00:53,092 --> 01:00:58,139
I'm now speaking a great work

946
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:04,055
we all aspire to do great things in our
lives I we've all got these great ideas

947
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:07,109
olive you have got undoubtedly ideas
already

948
01:01:08,009 --> 01:01:12,043
coming to mine for things are going to
do with I was a and with those 1070

949
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:16,120
I am n you know when we got these great
ideas

950
01:01:17,002 --> 01:01:24,002
it I it we also have these very high
standard for ourselves in many cases

951
01:01:24,026 --> 01:01:27,117
and when you've got these high standards
it's often difficult though to actually

952
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,029
realize them for a variety of reasons
beyond our own control

953
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:35,030
right wife is away and up taking charge

954
01:01:35,003 --> 01:01:39,042
but and that's why some of these great
ideas and such a big challenge

955
01:01:39,069 --> 01:01:42,072
but when you can pull them off its

956
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:47,084
its amazing I and it's definitely
something that's worth

957
01:01:47,084 --> 01:01:50,091
noting definitely notable moment and so

958
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:54,100
arm our next winner is is just an
incredible ap

959
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,087
that are was definitely a big idea

960
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:02,101
I think for them and they set out to do
something

961
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:06,044
fantastic and I think the achieve that

962
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:09,092
and our final award the FAF ternoon goes
to

963
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:16,092
Monument Valley by a computer

964
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:48,079
the Tom rattling

965
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,103
at Lincoln the whole 20 a

966
01:02:52,003 --> 01:02:55,072
Monument Valley is the

967
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:58,148
your real exploration through
fantastical architecture an impossible

968
01:02:59,048 --> 01:02:59,125
geometry

969
01:03:00,025 --> 01:03:04,056
guide the filing princess ida three
mysterious monument uncovering hidden

970
01:03:04,056 --> 01:03:06,059
powers unfolding optical Aleutian

971
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:13,086
to outsmart the enigmatic crow people

972
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:16,970
this is such an awesome game and

973
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:21,112
I don't know where the idea came from I
love to hear the story someday

974
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:25,522
but it is need to set out to do
something so big

975
01:03:25,729 --> 01:03:28,806
and the it the result is amazing so what
you're doing is you're taking this

976
01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:30,502
little princess Ida

977
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,853
you've got to get her to the top these
you know to the top of the themes in

978
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:36,180
this case the top of the tower there

979
01:03:36,018 --> 01:03:39,114
we're looking at this very Asher ask I
3d model

980
01:03:40,014 --> 01:03:43,603
and a lot of things don't line up and
anyway

981
01:03:43,729 --> 01:03:46,805
so we'll figure it out as we go number
one you know you can interact with

982
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:50,880
object on screen so this is pretty
straightforward with just happened

983
01:03:50,088 --> 01:03:53,094
teller where to go he's gonna go up here

984
01:03:53,094 --> 01:03:56,192
gonna put her up here but now now what
do we do %uh but you can

985
01:03:57,092 --> 01:04:01,241
you get these hands on screen that term
so you can turn this

986
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:06,087
and so Walker on here a we're gonna walk
her around

987
01:04:06,249 --> 01:04:09,294
but the surrounding now she's she's
gonna go and step on this special

988
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:10,680
platform

989
01:04:10,068 --> 01:04:13,497
which is now gonna deconstructing but

990
01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:17,173
you know when you look at this is like
okay now where she gonna go she can't

991
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:17,825
climb the

992
01:04:18,509 --> 01:04:21,578
that center pole she can't you know what
we do but

993
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:26,262
was just so cool about this up is that

994
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,892
2030 interact with these objects

995
01:04:30,459 --> 01:04:33,460
you realize like look what's going on
here

996
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:37,503
you didn't think that that top bar was
the same height as the other walkway

997
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:37,862
right

998
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:42,402
but as you start to rotate around
they've just done this great job

999
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:46,047
have going what you doin

1000
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:51,751
you know it's like it like that

1001
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:54,776
you know those there that has never and
written exactly the experience

1002
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:59,543
so they're here turn around now she's
going to get to the final destination

1003
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:03,680
rate answer she gets there we get this
power

1004
01:05:03,068 --> 01:05:06,647
that appears and now we get on to the
next level

1005
01:05:07,259 --> 01:05:11,640
and so she's gonna walk around here in
this

1006
01:05:11,064 --> 01:05:14,066
this just goes on and on and on and it's
just so

1007
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:18,915
awesome because in this level here she
suddenly learns to walk sideways

1008
01:05:19,509 --> 01:05:23,593
and walk on different surfaces and
doesn't hear she's going up here

1009
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:28,190
gonna walk around here and just go
through the

1010
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:31,608
now on track that's going on behind the
scene a like what is gonna go what is

1011
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:31,863
happening here

1012
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:36,641
right by me but if we turn I don't think
I've ever had to do this

1013
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:41,420
a was then the demo there can all I know
what to do I do it again i three

1014
01:05:41,042 --> 01:05:45,101
yeah I want to get to the back side
isn't no I can't do that a camera for

1015
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:49,910
its okay you gotta play the game of a
missile technology

1016
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:54,290
a great user experience fabulous art
that's optimized for retina display

1017
01:05:55,109 --> 01:05:58,145
and just such an intriguing experience a

1018
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:01,524
and you should just be super proud of
your work we really appreciate what
