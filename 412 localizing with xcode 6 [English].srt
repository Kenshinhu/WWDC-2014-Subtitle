1
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:15,133
well what time to a mall

2
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:20,070
welcome everybody to localization with
Xcode 6

3
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:25,007
my name is sold in forty Fisher and I'm
an engineer

4
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:30,082
with the Xcode team later my colleague
Chris Hansen will join me on stage

5
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,080
so you spend time on your

6
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:38,727
applications artwork you spend time on
your application's code

7
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,210
but you may yet have to configure your
Global Audience

8
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:48,029
the App Store is available in 150
countries around the world

9
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:53,620
here's a small fraction of them and
there are literally hundreds of millions

10
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,120
users shopping in the stores the
interesting thing is

11
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:01,094
there's no one dominant language around
the world

12
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:05,103
I O S is localizing to 40 languages

13
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:10,081
to reach a global audience to take your
applications to the next level

14
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:15,128
you simply must localize so if this
sounds like an interesting opportunity

15
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:21,054
you've come to the right place will
bring you guys up to speed

16
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:25,083
on Apple's award-winning

17
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,170
supports for I O S and Mac OS 10

18
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:33,025
and of course will details from the work
clothes in Xcode

19
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:37,105
to help you get your application
localized and for the old hands out

20
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:38,046
there

21
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,054
we have some new features that I think
you'll find very interesting

22
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:44,142
I want to take a step back for a moment
though and introduce a useful

23
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:45,123
distinction

24
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,057
internationalization isn't quite the
same

25
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:54,121
as localization I like to think I've

26
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,057
internationalization as a milestone

27
00:01:58,057 --> 00:02:04,069
on the path to a localized application
internationalization

28
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,418
is where you structure your application
to be

29
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,420
language in region independent that
involves

30
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:14,083
corralling the store strings

31
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,572
using interface builders auto

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,260
layout support and then once the
application is ready

33
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:25,077
then you can proceed to the second step

34
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:28,123
localization I should be clear that's

35
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,055
users around the world see your
applications

36
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:36,056
in very different ways so here's an

37
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:39,074
English application in the US region

38
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:44,214
here's the same application in mexico

39
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,000
and you'll notice that in addition to
being in Spanish

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,007
it's also got a subtle difference in the
days

41
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,099
here's the same application running in
Spain

42
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:58,067
also in Spanish but again

43
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,109
with a difference in the dates and the
number formats

44
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,097
so your applications going to have to
handle

45
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:10,145
these subtleties I'm gonna show you how

46
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:15,123
first we'll create and internationalize
application

47
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:21,070
and then later we'll localize it and
getting started

48
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:27,101
I'd like to introduce you to Chris
Hansen think is also

49
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:31,119
so as alton said internationalization

50
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:35,104
is the first step on the route to having
a fully localized application

51
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:39,023
I'd like to show you how to prepare your
application

52
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:43,172
and how to leverage Apple spring works
to prepare for localization

53
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,900
so we have some excellent framework
support for internationalization and

54
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,017
localization

55
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:54,105
in I'll ask analyst 10 and it's
completely pervasive

56
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:58,006
throughout the system frameworks
otherwise

57
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:01,011
I don't think we'd be able to localize I
last

58
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:05,100
into 40 languages and what our system
does

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,056
is separate your localize double data
from

60
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:12,093
the rest of your application thus making
it much

61
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:15,232
easier to produce localized Burton

62
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,120
variance up your application there are
actually

63
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,330
all built into a single fun

64
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:27,091
and these localized resources these
localized data

65
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:30,096
can be images sounds and movies

66
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:35,720
and documentation in addition to the
user facing taxed

67
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,240
in your application and even the user
facing tax

68
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:43,503
in your source code and as I said

69
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:48,180
it's extremely simple to use

70
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:51,030
now the first step is to start with

71
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:54,082
NS localized strain

72
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,401
and of localized string lets you
internationalize

73
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,603
strains that are used in your user
interface

74
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:05,093
but that come from your source code

75
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,400
and the way it Anna localized string
works

76
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,833
it lets you keep nice strings in your
code

77
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,930
such as format strings you don't have to
replace all the nice

78
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:19,112
readable strings in your code with some
sort of

79
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,014
all uppercase identifiers pointing into
a resource file

80
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,658
instead with annus localized string you
can keep those strings

81
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:31,210
as they are and still have your
application

82
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:34,068
fetch localized resources automatically

83
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,507
and that's the important part there's no
explicit

84
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:41,120
loading our management a very localized
strings needed

85
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:44,298
at all and

86
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,034
we have a couple variants annus
localized string

87
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,520
such as annus localized string from
Table but you can use

88
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:54,591
if you do need to keep different string
tables

89
00:05:55,059 --> 00:06:00,140
for different purposes what's just dive
into some code

90
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,960
here we have the kinda format string

91
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,115
little often appear in your code here
I'm just saying

92
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:13,019
how tall a particular Mountaineers so I
can assign that to a label

93
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:16,414
now obviously this string is in English

94
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:21,937
and it's completely on localized and on
international iced

95
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:27,271
so thats not really great for my users
who use other languages

96
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,036
fortunately all I have to do is wrapped
that

97
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,330
with NS localized spring and adding a
comment explaining what the string is

98
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,232
four

99
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,567
and I've made that code localized

100
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:44,941
well that comment is important because
it tells you localize urs

101
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,281
your translators just why you're using
map string

102
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:52,825
because different languages might use
different terminology

103
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,556
based on context so for example

104
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:00,991
a language might say that a person is

105
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,151
a certain height tall in a completely
different way

106
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:08,710
than says on mountain as a certain
height

107
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,596
of course that wasn't quite enough we
were using string with

108
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,267
for map we should actually switch

109
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,966
to localized string with format with
that'll do

110
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:24,750
is it'll insure that when we pass out
that height

111
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:28,858
as a number but that number is also
properly format

112
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,749
for the user's language and region

113
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:35,780
including such things as localized

114
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:40,100
digits because not everybody uses the
same

115
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,488
digit system the same Arabic numerals
that we ate use

116
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,662
in say the United States

117
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,050
and of course as with all of our system
frameworks

118
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:54,584
missus all available from swift as well
and in fact

119
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:57,636
I think you'll like how we've are how
we're handling

120
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,761
annus localized string in swept

121
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,320
now those localized strains when you
localize your application into another

122
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:07,514
language

123
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:13,407
Morcombe from a dictionary call the
local eyes will strings file

124
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:18,080
and this is a nice readable file with in
Xcode

125
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:21,497
where you can specify

126
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,616
all love your localize will strings a
course

127
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,114
salt and will show you how you don't
even have to offer these files yourself

128
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:32,827
how Xcode will take care of that for you

129
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,270
at the very beginning of a particular
entry in the file

130
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:40,032
you'll see that comments that you put in
your source code

131
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:43,118
and naps so somebody who is the
localizing up file

132
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:47,101
will know just what that spring is for

133
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:51,030
then the string exactly as it appears in
your code

134
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:54,058
will show up as a key in that file

135
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:57,144
and that's how are frameworks
localization system

136
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:03,049
will look up the string to use in
another language

137
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,102
and finally on the right hand side
you'll see on modified version of that

138
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:09,046
string

139
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:12,069
now hear this is Justin English file

140
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:15,167
but some languages actually use a
different word

141
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,076
order than English and instead of making
you

142
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:23,133
write some code to say well if I'm using
this language

143
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:28,036
then I need to pass my arguments to
string what format are localized string

144
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,119
with format in this order

145
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,045
and then in this other language I need
to pass them in a different order

146
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:36,067
you can pass them all in a stable order
in your code

147
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,155
and you don't have to right anything
language-specific

148
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:44,063
instead you can use this one dollar sign
in to dollar sign syntax

149
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:47,090
which Xcode will put in for you
automatically

150
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:52,066
to indicate what ordered the arguments
comin

151
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:57,101
and here's an example Justin English how
you might say the same thing

152
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,008
but in a different order and some
languages

153
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:04,103
world news one order some languages will
use another order

154
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:08,006
one order might be formal one order
might be informal

155
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:11,034
it doesn't really matter the point is

156
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:17,046
that Coco will take care out the heavy
lifting for you

157
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:21,081
now sorta but the next level of we have
NS formatter

158
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:24,160
a lot of what your app's do is present
information

159
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:28,057
from objects to users

160
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:34,100
an ounce human-readable tax and that's
exactly what for matters are four

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,088
for matters actually translate between

162
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:41,105
objects and human-readable taxed

163
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:45,007
not just from one to the other

164
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:49,038
and they can be used to bowl for
presenting and interpreting taxed

165
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:52,102
so if you're saying getting numeric
input from user

166
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:56,043
he'll probably want to use the formatter
just as much as you want to use a

167
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:56,110
formatter

168
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:01,019
to present numerical output

169
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:05,028
and for matters use the user's current
locale

170
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:08,050
the craft language region and other
settings

171
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:12,088
by default you don't have to do any
special setup or configuration

172
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:16,090
has hella formatter pay use the user's

173
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,011
specific language and region

174
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:23,134
so some very simple format or code

175
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:27,039
dates are actually extremely difficult

176
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:31,103
format properly for every language in
region in the world

177
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:35,099
and that's why we built support to them
into our system frameworks

178
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:40,123
so that everybody doesn't have to do
that work

179
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:45,114
here we are configuring the formatter to
present a medium-length

180
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:50,079
date string now that's a date string
that might not have the day of the week

181
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,124
but might present save them on and the
day and the year

182
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:59,033
only incense and in a state doesn't just
carry a day a year and a month

183
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:02,033
also carries a time

184
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:05,059
were telling this formatter that we
actually don't care about the time

185
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,063
that's in the date

186
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:10,081
we just care about the date portion
other

187
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:14,138
and of course what we have a formatter
set up we can just keep reusing it

188
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:19,056
so once we have a date we just need to
pass it through that formatter

189
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:22,143
using a string from date method in that
case than a state formatter

190
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,114
or in the equivalent method for any
other format urs and we can then

191
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:30,021
a sign up straight or label

192
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,181
and of course in swift this all looks
very similar

193
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:37,124
it's actually a little bit more concise
though thanks to Swift

194
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,115
in New Moon syntax now we have for
matters for dates

195
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:45,050
as I said but we also have for matters

196
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:49,078
for individual take components and for
time intervals which are also very hard

197
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:50,076
to get

198
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:53,079
right now all situations we also have

199
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,144
for matters for numbers and Ford

200
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,044
formatting and number specifically as
currency

201
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:03,127
which might have slightly different
rules and even for formatting

202
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:08,125
by counsel such as the number of bytes
or megabytes uploaded for download

203
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,069
that way you don't have to figure out
how to format that properly in your app

204
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,133
stumps out

205
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:18,131
and new in iowa say and OS 10 yosemite

206
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:23,105
we have support for for matters for
health related quantities

207
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:27,042
such as energy in calories in
kilocalories

208
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:33,080
we have for matters for length and
height we have for matters from mass

209
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:37,010
and this way you can present this
information consistently to user

210
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,133
with other APs on the system

211
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:45,051
now underlying all of this is the
concept of a bundle

212
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:48,123
your caps are actually built into
directories not single files

213
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:52,095
those directories are called bundles and
that doesn't just cover your caps that

214
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:55,109
goes here ap extensions and your
frameworks and everything else on a

215
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,045
system to

216
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,120
and NS bundle provides an API

217
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:07,016
that's the standard way to access
resources within those bundles

218
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:11,079
in when you use Ennis bundles APIs

219
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,174
they automatically get the most
appropriate resources for your current

220
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:19,172
language

221
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:24,141
and what's more building bundles is
directly supported by Xcode

222
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,130
so when you have localized resources in
your application

223
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:33,016
you don't need to write scripts to place
them in the right place

224
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:36,127
in your app just how Xcode that their
localize

225
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:40,084
and what language therefore Xcode what
automatically

226
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:44,129
include them in the right place

227
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,048
the INS bundle API is very simple here
we see

228
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:52,095
getting a resource that represent the
game menu

229
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:56,110
from our main bundle which represents
our out and then we're just creating an

230
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:57,930
image with it

231
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:03,480
and assigning it to I you I image via

232
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:06,141
now most of the time these are very
common operations

233
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,116
so we have some shorthand in our
frameworks for them for example you I

234
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:11,075
image

235
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:14,079
has the image names method and that'll
just

236
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,079
automatically go to and a fumble

237
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,155
for your main bundle and after that
image and it'll even handle differences

238
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:26,059
in things like the path extension for
you

239
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:30,132
but not everything is going to come from
one of those methods

240
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:36,048
for example if I wanna play a welcome
message when my application starts up

241
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:39,124
I'm probably going to want that audio
message

242
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:43,062
to be localized as well

243
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:47,073
but eighty audio player doesn't simply
have a

244
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:50,125
player with file method that's okay

245
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:55,049
we can just get for your health
programming bundle to that message

246
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:58,058
and then pass it along to AV audio
player because those URL's

247
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,738
are just a regular URL's there's nothing
special about them

248
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:08,570
requires any form translation before
they can be passed all swear

249
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:12,130
and as always we support this and swept

250
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:16,010
and in swift

251
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:19,133
when years following sort of a chain of
methods like this

252
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:23,111
you can actually use the let syntax so
you don't accidentally

253
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:27,063
reassign to one of these variables I
find out

254
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:30,157
really handy

255
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,065
now let's talk about walls

256
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:37,069
syntax could 5 which supported the
concept called

257
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:40,160
base internationalization in Xcode

258
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:44,010
that helps you internationalize your
interface

259
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,019
by keeping your strengths that are in
the interface files

260
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,070
separate from the from the you why
components

261
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:55,052
that are in those interface files

262
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,108
and of course in Xcode we also make it
very easy to localize your

263
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:04,073
other project resources as you need to

264
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:08,172
a new in Xcode 6 we have some powerful
preview features

265
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:13,085
that you preview how your application
will look in other regions

266
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:17,112
and in other languages both while it's
running

267
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:22,671
and directly within Xcode in Interface
Builder

268
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,860
but first let's talk a little bit more
about bass internationalization

269
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,593
as I said keeps

270
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,670
your strengths and your user facing
taxed

271
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,740
separate from your interface objects

272
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:40,075
so the placeholder text that you put in
to your

273
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:44,173
I V storyboard or your ZIP files

274
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,962
is only representative up your
development language

275
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,283
what this means is that when you have
other languages

276
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:56,550
added to your project you only need to
change the strings

277
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:01,061
you don't need to go through any more
and adjust every single zip file

278
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:07,617
every single storyboard for every single
language you support

279
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:11,456
and for other resources we just show
them

280
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:15,470
exactly the same way that we show
localized strings in Xcode

281
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:18,236
so as an example I have an app here

282
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:22,747
that house a stop sign icon and a yield
sign i cud what

283
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,600
those have text on them so

284
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:29,455
I'm probably going to want a different
stop sign icon

285
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,830
and a different you don't find icon at
least for the tax possibly even for the

286
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:33,662
shape

287
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:39,456
for English and for Swedish and you can
do this with

288
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:44,320
any kinda resource images sounds

289
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:47,841
movies documentation

290
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:54,180
and really any kind of resource that you
can put in Xcode and any project

291
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:57,665
Xcode knows about the structure bundles

292
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,976
so you don't have to tell it hey I want
these

293
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,690
over here no I want those over there

294
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:08,086
Xcode just knows and what automatically
put everything in the right place

295
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:11,109
in your app

296
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:15,018
now new in Xcode 6 we support

297
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:19,182
preview at runtime: this debug time
preview

298
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:24,521
is accessed through the and its schema
she where you can set

299
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,350
your application language from a pop-up

300
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,049
and this pop-up will let you pick the
system one which

301
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:36,054
it'll let you pick any language into
which application has been localized

302
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:41,368
and also pick a couple had let you pick
a couple of pseudo languages

303
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,351
that I'll explain a little bit later

304
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,228
but that's not all we've also added the
ability

305
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:56,440
ID's preview assistant to select

306
00:19:56,044 --> 00:20:01,383
I'll language in which you want to
preview your nap

307
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:05,490
so you can preview your interface by
just selecting

308
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,348
any language in which your application
has been translated

309
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,840
from the language pop-up in the lower
right corner

310
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,570
up the preview window

311
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:19,656
now we also support a pseudo language

312
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:24,241
directly within I B for checking your
auto layout constraints

313
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:30,956
and I'll show you that a little bit
later too

314
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,566
and here it is im than a little bit so
you can read it

315
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:41,460
now the stages of internationalization

316
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:44,069
are simply to identify the strings that
you're going to use for your

317
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:46,084
translations

318
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:50,283
to make sure that your application is
properly using base internationalization

319
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,062
and auto layout and then it should

320
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:58,850
localize any other project resources
that you need

321
00:20:58,085 --> 00:21:02,354
my like to show that to you now index
had sex

322
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,137
so here I have an application

323
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,720
that when I run it will show some
earthquake data

324
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:13,123
from the US Geological Survey its Web
data feed now I'm not actually using

325
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:18,352
live feed so don't be alarmed if you see
anything in there

326
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,571
on the other hand we also want to see
what might be going on

327
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,701
this is California after all

328
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,830
and you can see that in this app I have

329
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,742
a nice big title I have

330
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:37,544
a label indicating where particular
earthquake happened

331
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,210
I have a graphic indicating that mag and
well

332
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:44,300
indicating the strength for severity of
that earthquake

333
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:50,532
the dayton time with that quake and its
magnitude on the Richter scale

334
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:53,977
and then when I press her when I tap

335
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:57,610
one of these earthquakes

336
00:21:57,061 --> 00:22:00,630
I also got action she allowing me to see
that earthquake

337
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:04,350
on the US Geological Survey website

338
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:08,074
and to see its location in maps

339
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:12,427
now there's a lot of strings a lot of
text in this interface

340
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:17,769
and where does it all come from well I
need to figure that out to make sure

341
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,830
that my application is properly
internationalized

342
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,172
so to start with let's take a look at
that action she

343
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,976
I happen to know but that's brought up
for my table views delegate

344
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:33,340
which happens to be my main view
controller to and I just have

345
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:36,693
a straightforward method called present
actions for earthquake

346
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:40,008
that shows those actions

347
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:43,986
and here you can see that to present
their work she I'm using the new in Iowa

348
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:45,700
State class

349
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:50,226
you wyler controller weren't adding
alert actions

350
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:54,933
but here I'm just passing the title

351
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,155
string directly to my UI alert action

352
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:05,350
that means that even if I am running
this application and Swedish or Hindi

353
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,084
I'm still going to see this English
taxed

354
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:13,230
cell I'm just going to wrap this in NS
localized string like it took them like

355
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:18,023
I showed you

356
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:25,023
and I'm also going to put in a comment
indicating what this string is for

357
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,075
and that's all I have to do

358
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:35,157
to ensure that this tax will come from
my localized strings

359
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:41,060
when running in other languages now I
also have the same problem

360
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:45,072
with my maps action title and even with
my counsel title

361
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:50,026
I could adjust those here but in the
interest of time

362
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:54,113
let's just pretend that I did now
there's

363
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:58,182
course a bunch more text here I should
be the turned the

364
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,850
the name up the earthquake or rather the
location at the earthquake

365
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:04,160
and the dates and the magnitude

366
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:09,040
up that earthquake now those are going
to be in my table view cell

367
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:12,136
ok because this is just a standard
tableview application

368
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:18,045
and when I select my cell I have a handy
configure with earthquake method

369
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:26,026
that pops up my interface for me now
finds him in here a little bit

370
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:32,101
you can see that I'm just passing the
location

371
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,950
up that earthquake straight over to my
location label

372
00:24:35,095 --> 00:24:38,694
and that's just tax that comes from the
USGS datafeed

373
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,840
however I'm not passing the date

374
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:45,122
directly to that date label instead

375
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:49,107
I'm passing it through a date for matter
that I've configured as a property

376
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:53,496
and the same is true with my magnitude

377
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,970
I'm not happen it directly I'm not using
string.format

378
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:59,132
instead I'm passing through a number
formatter

379
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:04,050
I'm just going to command click that
property so that shows

380
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:07,534
in Xcode of scroll down just a little
bit here so this is more visible

381
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:11,850
up and you can see that this property

382
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:14,524
it's just only easily initialized number
formatter

383
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,363
where i'm saying the I want that
magnitude

384
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:24,032
to be presented in a decimal format and
because

385
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,770
earthquakes he's a logarithmic scale we
tend to

386
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:31,114
always want to present a fractional
portion

387
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:36,053
so I just tell my formatter

388
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,980
I always want to show the decimal
separator and then watch a show at least

389
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,134
one fractional digits

390
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:46,035
and actually so as to avoid overflowing
my label

391
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:51,052
I only wanna show one fractional digit
and for that date

392
00:25:52,024 --> 00:25:56,933
I'm just telling my date formatter the
taiwanese a medium style

393
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:00,360
in for the time

394
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:03,835
I want to use a short style for the day
I don't really care

395
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,770
the earthquake happened on a Saturday or
a Wednesday I just care about the actual

396
00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:11,616
day of the month and the month in the
year and for the time

397
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:15,710
I don't really care about the
milliseconds at least in this app

398
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:19,076
I just want to know the sure the minute
time that earthquake

399
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:23,112
so we've got a lot of work

400
00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:28,018
actually make sure that we're getting
everything from localized resources

401
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:32,501
and or passing our data through for
matters know what does that actually get

402
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:33,154
us

403
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:38,140
well we haven't translated the app yet
but if I just stop it

404
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:42,663
and go to my edits scheme sheet I can
look under the options

405
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:46,940
and I have my application language
pop-up

406
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:49,112
in my application region pop up

407
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:54,051
now this is big menu sign going to zoom
back out and I'm going to choose

408
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,224
Sweden so I can see how r manager would
see this application

409
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:05,720
when he is back home in Sweden was going
to close the sheet

410
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:08,080
and rerun my application and you can see

411
00:27:09,052 --> 00:27:13,123
but even know the text is an English
still a number of things about the

412
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:14,702
application

413
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:17,913
changed for example the date in time

414
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,342
are presented differently in Sweden
evidently

415
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,681
the day above the month comes before the
month

416
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,250
whereas in the United States we tend to
write the month

417
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:33,554
and then the day and Sweeney the is a
24-hour clock instead of a 12-hour clock

418
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,220
like in the United States

419
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:38,085
and finally one of the most noticeable
differences

420
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:41,774
in Sweden the comma is the decimal
separator

421
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,340
rather than the period and the system
frameworks

422
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:53,034
handled out for me just by using a
formatter

423
00:27:55,082 --> 00:28:00,174
now let's take a look at our interface
in Interface Builder

424
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:04,087
I'm just going to select that earthquake
seen that i'm looking at in the

425
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:07,133
simulator

426
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:11,084
and I'm going to bring up the preview
assistant

427
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:17,088
that we introduce the next good pop

428
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:22,175
and here I can select the preview

429
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,101
and in addition to allowing me to
preview

430
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:31,032
the application in different
orientations down in the lower right

431
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:36,051
I kept also select own language in which
a preview the application

432
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:40,053
so here my move over a little bit you
can see that I only have my development

433
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:40,120
language

434
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:44,056
actually in this project however

435
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:48,108
under the separator I also have one
close to two languages I mentioned

436
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:53,077
a double length pseudo language so if I
select this

437
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:56,084
and zoom out what do I C

438
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:59,160
well all of my labels have had their
taxed

439
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:03,010
double in this is to simulate

440
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,036
running your application in a more
verbose language

441
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,094
a language that uses more tax to say
something

442
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:14,135
for example German tends to use about 30
percent more

443
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:19,058
space than English does to say about the
same thing

444
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:22,357
on the other hand there are some
languages that use even less space than

445
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:25,220
English to say the same thing

446
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:28,109
and your applications interface needs to
accommodate them

447
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:32,548
all fortunately auto layout

448
00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:37,620
will do most of the work for you and
this preview assisted

449
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:41,111
lets you see that its actually working

450
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:44,960
for example I actually do help

451
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:47,178
all and auto layout issue in this
preview

452
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:52,347
you can see that the magnitude field has
an ellipse the Senate

453
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:58,360
indicating that its text is overflowing
the label

454
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:02,098
now the largest earthquake that ever
been recorded was a 9.5

455
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:05,107
so this probably isn't an issue

456
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:09,316
at least for this out however it is
something

457
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:13,382
that you'll probably want to take into
consideration

458
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,280
a course not all the text in this
preview was doubled

459
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:20,037
that's because this heading says
prototype cells

460
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:23,135
and thus are this background that says
tableview prototype contact

461
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:27,103
those are actually part up interface
builders user interface

462
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:33,037
and not your own text

463
00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:36,096
now if I wanted to localize this graphic

464
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:39,720
because it uses color and color is
another

465
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:42,110
language and a region dependent

466
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:49,016
are piece of information network also be
very easy in Xcode

467
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:53,084
we just select the image I wanna
localize

468
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,370
and then open the inspector and go to
the inspectors

469
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,860
localization section and we have this
nice big a localized fun

470
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:06,875
that will turn any resource into a
localized resource

471
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,710
and that but we'll just bring up a
pop-up alert

472
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:15,750
asks where I want no what localization I
want that resource to be a part of

473
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:17,454
initially

474
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,120
now it can actually be a part on the
base

475
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,109
internationalization because it doesn't
have a place

476
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:29,033
as an image into which I can substitute
strings

477
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:32,072
however I can make it apart might
English

478
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:38,086
localization and let's talk about what
we just saw

479
00:31:38,086 --> 00:31:42,115
we saw how the system frameworks

480
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:45,890
I last and OS 10

481
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,960
will really do a lot of the heavy
lifting

482
00:31:48,096 --> 00:31:53,110
for you and internationalization and
localization

483
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:58,074
we saw how you can use the debug time
preview to check your region support

484
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,382
because after all even a few don't
localize your application

485
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,270
your users are still going to be in
different regions all over the world

486
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:11,034
and use different conventions

487
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:16,046
and we saw how you can take advantage of
design time previews

488
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:19,122
and bass internationalization to ensure
that your application is properly

489
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,027
reactive

490
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:26,741
when it comes to the length a text in
the interface

491
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:31,415
and of course you can localize other
project resources to

492
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,790
as you need to now to talk about the
actual process

493
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,398
%uh localizing and translating
application

494
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:46,109
I'm going to hand things back to Bolton

495
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,478
thanks Chris so you saw how Chris
prepared and internationalized

496
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,600
application

497
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:56,040
he structured it to be language in
region independence

498
00:32:56,094 --> 00:32:59,135
and you saw how the frameworks provided
some of the

499
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:03,097
localize data for users around the world
for free

500
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:07,100
so what's left to do

501
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,119
well it turns out that the book and the
remaining work

502
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,171
is to translate your user facing strings

503
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:19,190
and this is still best done by an
expert's

504
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:23,718
in the language and not just machine
translation

505
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:29,040
so your challenge is to extract those
strings

506
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:34,373
from your projects then packing them up
from your translator

507
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:38,830
for your translator after they've
translated them you have to

508
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:44,432
integrate them back into your project
sounds like a lot work

509
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:51,090
well I'm pleased to announce an Xcode 6
we've streamline this process

510
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:54,228
Xcode will now carefully examine you are

511
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,780
I B resources and your source files

512
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:01,097
and extracts the source strings for you

513
00:34:01,097 --> 00:34:05,101
who generates and open X left formats

514
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:10,022
now this is a mature standards that's
accepted by

515
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:13,121
a number of translation companies around
the world

516
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:16,402
and is compatible with the number
translation tools

517
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:20,990
so when translators insert their work

518
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,135
into the X left they would then

519
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:27,344
returned the exe file to you

520
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,990
and then you simply imported into your
project

521
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,197
and then Xcode will meticulously crepes
the resources are

522
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:39,103
update existing resources to put the
translations where they need to go

523
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:43,622
so you no longer have to run Jan string
so I B tool

524
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:50,649
in order to do this

525
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:56,124
thank you actually there now

526
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:00,687
so here's the project that Chris created
earlier

527
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm just gonna navigate to the projects
where you find a lot of the

528
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:12,092
localization related details so here you
can see that at the moment

529
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,025
it's only gots English in this project

530
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:22,100
so

531
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,599
if I want to extract the source strings
from this project I simply go up to the

532
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,480
editor menu

533
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:33,054
and choose export for localization a
choose a destination

534
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:36,118
the home folder and then Xcode

535
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:42,025
generates the exe file based on what is
found in the project

536
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:49,025
I'll show you that quickly

537
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:58,650
it's simply an XML file and down here
you can see the

538
00:35:58,065 --> 00:36:02,134
source strings the Chris localizer
internationalize earlier

539
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:06,043
and the comments to the added to the
translator

540
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:09,104
so now imagine that I

541
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:14,006
send that to my translation team I would
email letter uploaded to

542
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:19,100
their service and after they've
completed their work

543
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,043
when I want to import these translations

544
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:29,046
I go back to the editor menu and choose
import localizations

545
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:32,122
here some

546
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:36,117
prepared earlier now I've heard that
smorgasbord is

547
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:40,098
race in Sweden but personally I've for
curry in India

548
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:46,099
so we've got some Hindi translations and
Xcode

549
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:49,228
is inserting those translations

550
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,192
into the project now you can see that's

551
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,200
Hindi is added to the project's

552
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:03,671
and thats when I disclose the storyboard
very in Peru

553
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:07,380
there's strings files waiting for us

554
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:13,133
and if I choose to run this application

555
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:17,040
are used to you debug time

556
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:22,054
menu I'll choose Hindi

557
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:25,090
I'll choose to preview its

558
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,458
as if the user in India

559
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:36,349
and now

560
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:41,207
you can see that beautiful script in
place the dates have changed

561
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:45,092
the region the number formatter

562
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,500
is the same as in the US and this is one
of the things I like about the

563
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:52,073
preview feature it's immediately obvious
that

564
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:56,019
this is not in the right script the
title of this

565
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:00,019
events so in this case you would ideally
use

566
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:05,092
a localized feed I also like to point
out this is available on the command

567
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:05,153
line

568
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:10,054
so you can now use the export
localization

569
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,152
and import localization burbs to build
this into your

570
00:38:14,052 --> 00:38:21,052
localization workflows and to automate
this process as you want

571
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:26,415
so you seen how

572
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,290
Xcode six will now streamline this
process

573
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:33,068
localizing your application how will

574
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:38,089
help you to communicate with your
translator

575
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:45,089
in this open X live format so now that
you've got to localize application

576
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:48,143
you'd like to keep it that way

577
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:52,722
and you'd like to build confidence

578
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:56,150
that it is going to appeal to a global
audience

579
00:38:56,015 --> 00:38:59,019
so I'd like to invite Chris back on
stage

580
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:02,073
to show you how to best maintain this
application

581
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,192
and build confidence but it's ready for
a global audience

582
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:09,630
thank is often that's pretty cool stuff
so

583
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:12,762
of course you probably don't want to put
off

584
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:16,470
localizing application on children very

585
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:19,095
end up your development process that
sounds a lot like a waterfall

586
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,166
development and we really want to be

587
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:24,089
iterative these days and the

588
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:27,094
export and import workload results and
show you

589
00:39:27,094 --> 00:39:30,493
allows you to do that it allows you to
do

590
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:34,392
when I like to think up as continuous
localization

591
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:40,520
because you can x4 and import at will
this what's your stage a localized

592
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:43,891
as you work and you can use previews

593
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:48,250
to catch missing or bogus translations

594
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:53,029
very easily and

595
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:57,046
week even include some tools that let
you prepare your application

596
00:39:57,046 --> 00:40:00,047
for right-to-left languages like

597
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:04,656
Arabic in hebrew independently of
translating your application

598
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,400
into those languages that can make it
much

599
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:12,087
easier to actually experiment with your
user interface

600
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:16,872
even if you don't speak or read Arabic
or Hebrew

601
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,670
so I just like to show you that

602
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:27,196
right in Xcode so let's say

603
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:33,170
I've been working on my project for a
while and I've just received my spanish

604
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:33,966
translation

605
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,166
back from my translator to import

606
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:41,640
all I have to do is as all time showed

607
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,100
suck my project and then choose

608
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,075
import localizations and I'm going to
pullin

609
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:53,173
mine Spanish XLA file now what happened
here

610
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:58,096
unlike with salt and showed you with
Hindi there appears to be an

611
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:01,455
issue with this translation while

612
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,750
it turns out there it's missing

613
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:10,094
the show location and maps functionality
I must've actually exported the spring

614
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:10,189
localization

615
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:15,177
before I added that feature to my apt
but thats

616
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:19,123
okay I can still import this

617
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:23,023
incomplete localization and at least

618
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:26,079
see my application as it is right now

619
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,868
with all of the localization has been
completed for Spanish

620
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:36,790
so I'm just going to import that and if
I disclose my storyboard here

621
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,408
I can see that now I have strings in
both Hindi

622
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:47,119
and Spanish fort now for wanna see how
my application actually runs

623
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:51,334
as always I can just use my application
language

624
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,950
in this case Spanish now they've had
that localization

625
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,179
and also choose the spin region

626
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,114
so I can see me how somebody who speaks
Spanish

627
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:05,243
in Spain would see my application

628
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,910
now I run this

629
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:11,164
I see that earthquakes here

630
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:16,117
isn't localized that must have been
another thing that might

631
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:20,896
our translator missed and

632
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:24,103
if I tap an earthquake

633
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:28,440
I can see that one of my actions and the
cancel button

634
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:32,103
are translated but that button that I
called out earlier

635
00:42:33,003 --> 00:42:37,342
has not been

636
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:41,240
now if I'd wanted to see this right in
Interface Builder

637
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:46,048
I could select my main story port let's
just select that earthquake seen

638
00:42:46,048 --> 00:42:49,157
and bring up the preview window again

639
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:55,000
the preview a system I should say

640
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,019
and if I choose my Spanish localization
and Interface Builder

641
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:03,096
I can see that some of my place over
labels have been translated

642
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:06,163
however this birth quakes title

643
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:10,067
is not only all in English but it's
actually

644
00:43:11,003 --> 00:43:14,302
been changed all capital letters

645
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:17,333
and that's actually the frameworks
calling out to me

646
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:20,810
that they will recognize this should be
coming

647
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:23,590
from a localized resource but it wasn't

648
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,810
found I can get the same effect

649
00:43:28,081 --> 00:43:31,177
in the edit scheme she when running my
application

650
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:35,102
by choosing this new shown on localized

651
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:39,031
strings option

652
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:43,300
so if I just stop and rerun my
application now that I've seen

653
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,990
have set that I can see that

654
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:53,099
earthquakes is called out and all
capital letters

655
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,640
now I said you can export and import
Atwell

656
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:08,068
and one reason that you want to export
is because

657
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:11,068
you'll be adding features your
application as you go

658
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:16,103
and you'll want those new features that
you add to be translated

659
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:21,054
and you export in exactly the same way
no matter when you do it

660
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:25,313
you simply select your project and shoes
export for localization

661
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:30,190
but ivory added some localizations to
this app

662
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:33,898
so what happens or Xcode gives me a
choice

663
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:39,040
and whether I just want to export
strings in the development language

664
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:43,040
or if when generating the XLA files

665
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:46,006
I should already include the strings

666
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:49,441
in the translations that house

667
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:52,822
this way I can handle it was actual
files

668
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,890
to my translators and they concede from
work but they've

669
00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:00,100
already done and won't redo it

670
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,038
instead they'll only do the work needed

671
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:08,041
for the new and change strings

672
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:12,074
so if I save this and replace the one
that was already there

673
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:15,102
I can see now in the home folder

674
00:45:16,002 --> 00:45:19,048
that I have 3d

675
00:45:19,048 --> 00:45:22,397
exported localizations in actual a
format

676
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:29,810
one in English one in Spanish and one in
Hindi

677
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:32,118
a finely I'd like to show you what your
app would look like

678
00:45:33,018 --> 00:45:36,040
in a right to left language for
convenience

679
00:45:36,004 --> 00:45:42,973
was gonna bring up the storyboard again
so we have something to compare against

680
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:46,390
start me up from running in the
simulator and

681
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,660
I'm going to edit my scheme once more

682
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:52,124
this time I'm just gonna set my region
back to the system region

683
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:56,079
but I'm going to set my language shoe
the new

684
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,858
right to left pseudo language

685
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:04,380
now when you're using a right-to-left
language

686
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:09,042
on and iPhone or an iPad or Mac

687
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:13,045
it's not just attacks that goes from
right to left

688
00:46:13,072 --> 00:46:17,073
the entire direction other user
interface

689
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:20,672
is changed based on how the user

690
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:24,710
prefers to read

691
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:28,660
well just also turn off my shown on
localized string setting here

692
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:33,920
and let's see how auto layout reacts to
just changing the user interface

693
00:46:33,092 --> 00:46:39,100
direction

694
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,579
well because we use the concept love
leading-edge

695
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,140
and trailing edge rather than left and
right

696
00:46:47,014 --> 00:46:50,933
in are auto layout for this app

697
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,920
most of the app just flips right to left

698
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:58,148
just doesn't Arabic or Hebrew user would
see it

699
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:02,147
we have our magnitude all the way on the
left

700
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,624
instead of all the way on the right next
to it

701
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:10,110
is are graphic indicating the severity
of an earthquake

702
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:14,230
and then we have some text overlapping

703
00:47:14,023 --> 00:47:17,116
that indicates that we probably still
have a little bit of work to do

704
00:47:18,016 --> 00:47:22,155
on making this fully support right to
left taxed

705
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:26,430
now the frameworks do that but I
probably just have a bug in my

706
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:29,115
auto layout constraints and this preview

707
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:36,031
helped me find before I actually went to
the trouble of trampling my application

708
00:47:36,031 --> 00:47:39,040
and I don't have to understand

709
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:46,319
Hebrew or Arabic in order to debug that
problem

710
00:47:46,075 --> 00:47:49,149
so what we saw with how you can update
your translations

711
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:54,077
and as you go to keep your app current
and really continue to do

712
00:47:54,077 --> 00:48:00,176
iterative development at the same time
that you're app is being translated

713
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:03,916
well so far how you can use the various
kinds a preview

714
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:07,435
to capture missing translations before
your users

715
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:13,305
and possibly even before your key way
ever sees them

716
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,406
and we saw how you can simulate many
different behaviors

717
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:21,660
between regional formatting and even
right to left taxed

718
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:24,074
to ensure your caps work the best they
can for

719
00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:28,141
everyone because that's really what it's
all about

720
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:32,066
reaching a global audience are

721
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:35,124
frameworks for iowa's analysts 10

722
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:39,097
make that really easy especially

723
00:48:39,097 --> 00:48:42,131
if you take advantage a Xcode new work
clothes

724
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:46,079
for axel F export-import and

725
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,172
for previewing localizations at debug
time

726
00:48:50,072 --> 00:48:55,081
and at design-time there are some
related sessions

727
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:59,102
there is actually one earlier today
called advanced topics in

728
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:01,321
internationalization

729
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:06,381
the QoS in deep into what you need to do
in terms of formatting and

730
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:11,150
code to deal with all the subtleties of
internationalization

731
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:14,077
for example mixing right to left and
left to right: taxed

732
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:18,079
and that's actually the sequel to a
session that was held last year

733
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,096
that it also encourage you to check out
in the WWDC

734
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:24,100
ap and as always

735
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,018
the advanced topics internationalization
is going to be available for streaming

736
00:49:29,018 --> 00:49:30,847
soon

737
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,700
there's also an caps for China get
together tomorrow

738
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:38,079
at work add up 4:30 for anybody who's
interested in tapping this

739
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:42,471
huge new market thank you very much
