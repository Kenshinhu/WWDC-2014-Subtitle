1
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:19,068
well everyone

2
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:21,076
so

3
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:24,082
I Mike Stern on the user experience
evangelist at Apple

4
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:29,965
and thank you all for coming on sticking
around after a really long day very

5
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:31,293
technical content

6
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,348
now this presentation is going to be a
bit different

7
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:37,620
right this is about design and in
particular

8
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:41,321
it's about designing intuitive
interfaces I'd like to

9
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,430
start with little exercise Magin

10
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:48,047
if you will that your house and your

11
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:52,122
in your kitchen and the phone rings and
the person on the other end the line has

12
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:54,029
some really exciting news for you

13
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:57,831
they tell you you one some money

14
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,280
not just a little bit of money but like
a lot of money

15
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:06,033
and they also tell you that in order to
claim your prize

16
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:09,707
you need to call a phone number

17
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,490
and then that hang up the phone

18
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,142
so you're sitting there in your kitchen
and you need to write down this phone

19
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:19,047
number

20
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:22,176
you need to write down this phone number
before you forget

21
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:26,161
so you're looking around for something
to

22
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:30,116
to write with your iPhone not around
right and

23
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:34,037
is casting around and you're starting to
get a little panicky because you really

24
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,081
want to remember this number in

25
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:39,092
right before you forget it you see a pen
and a piece of paper

26
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:42,160
and you write down the phone number so
that's a pretty

27
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:48,029
simple scenario right now the end of the
story by the way thank you

28
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:53,172
thank you very much so you had this very
clear objective which was to write down

29
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,081
this phone number

30
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,470
and you found a pen and pad of paper
with which to accomplish that task

31
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:04,065
and then you wrote down the phone number
now is it

32
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:07,464
well not really quite that simple

33
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:12,090
you're under pressure you're stressing
out a little bit

34
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,860
and when you're stressed out that can
affect your memory and it can affect

35
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,104
your ability to perform basic

36
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:21,013
cognitive tasks such as remembering the
phone number

37
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,049
and writing it down or picking out a pen
from a bunch of similar objects

38
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:31,088
things that look just like a pen and
assuming that you can remember the phone

39
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:31,525
number and

40
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,620
find the pen and paper and write it down
you have to also consider what are all

41
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:38,104
the skills that are necessary for you to
write

42
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:42,623
for starters writing involves a lot of
coordination and

43
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,756
dexterity just ask a three-year-old

44
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,970
they totally suck your writing

45
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:52,836
and so did all love you and so did I

46
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,640
when we're that age we went from writing
like this

47
00:02:57,064 --> 00:03:01,090
to writing like that or

48
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:07,017
really something like this writing with
a pen takes years and years a practice

49
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:11,161
and there's all these small little
skills that you need to learn along the

50
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:12,122
way

51
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:17,043
there so fluid and natural to you now
but they weren't always so easy

52
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:21,090
you had to gain the high hand
coordination to be able to pick up

53
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:25,083
and manipulate small objects and it took
years to learn how to

54
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:31,065
hold the pen properly position arrest on
the table on your arm for stability

55
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:34,116
you had to learn how to draw basic
letterforms

56
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:39,039
right along a straight line you need to
learn the difference between upper case

57
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,064
and lower case letters

58
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:43,883
the list goes on but you don't think
about

59
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,330
any of those things when you're sitting
in your kitchen and writing down that

60
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:48,772
phone number

61
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:54,140
all those years

62
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:58,035
writing with different types of pens and
pencils and markers and

63
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:02,084
crayons have given you this tremendous
amount of muscle memory

64
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:05,182
and that muscle memory frees you to
remember something

65
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:09,167
like phone number if you had to
consciously

66
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:14,134
remember all those individual skills it
would be pretty difficult for you to

67
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:16,097
have accomplished that task

68
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:21,182
in other words

69
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:27,082
it easier for you to have written down
and remember that phone number

70
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:31,153
because the active writing is so
intuitive using software

71
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:36,116
is no different the more aP's behaviors
we expect them to

72
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:41,078
the more intuitive they are to us more
intuitive outs are to us

73
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:44,163
the easier it is for us to concentrate
on our true objectives

74
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:50,067
whether that's communicating with
friends capturing memories of loved ones

75
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:58,003
checking the weather are exploring the
cosmos the very best

76
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:01,051
user interfaces are so intuitive so
natural

77
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,063
that the disorder disappear and allow us
to focus on

78
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:08,109
what truly matters that is what we call

79
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:13,046
intuitive so with that in mind

80
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:19,065
what makes a nap intuitive well I put
together a list of what I believe to be

81
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,153
the top five characteristics

82
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:25,080
have intuitive user interface designs
this is not

83
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:29,086
an exhaustive list we could be here for
hours and hours and hours

84
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:33,153
talking about all the things that make
something intuitive we would order pizza

85
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:37,146
get your ex would be a lot of fun but
unfortunately we don't have the time for

86
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:38,108
that today

87
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:42,036
this list to five things

88
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:46,083
i think is the most basic and essential
characteristics what makes Iowa

89
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,146
for Mac App intuitive and I also want to
point out

90
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:53,059
up front hear that what's intuitive to
one person

91
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,064
may not be so intuitive to others I mean

92
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,021
this is intuitive if you're an airline
pilot

93
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:04,099
everybody and every square to read
display is there for very good reason

94
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,104
you know were everything is

95
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:13,049
totally natural pretty sure this doesn't
work

96
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:19,030
I also want to point out that these are
the most fundamental things the most

97
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,009
basic things

98
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:23,050
but the line is just like anything else
in life I mean

99
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:26,034
sometimes the most basic things are the
most important

100
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,958
the most consequential I've been
designing for many years and I've seen

101
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,020
time and time again

102
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:36,015
even the most seasoned the most
experienced designers

103
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:40,594
who make poor quality designs because
they've lost sight of the fundamentals

104
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,870
now in order for be

105
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,093
a pen to be intuitive needs to get some
very fundamental

106
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:52,996
for basic things just right and needs to
be wide enough to grip firmly

107
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,441
but not so wide that it can be
manipulated

108
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,639
easily if the pain is too thin

109
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,840
are too wide it becomes intuitive
because we become aware of it

110
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:06,177
for trying to think how we gonna right
with this pen it doesn't feel quite

111
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:07,134
right

112
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:11,105
or for Penn was too short

113
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:17,034
we will not know how to hold it right we
pick it up with your fingertips and

114
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:19,107
we'll be riding with it be going all
over the place in

115
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:24,030
what we right when it looked very good
would be very conscious at the Penn

116
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:29,003
itself or pen was too long been opposite
problem

117
00:07:29,003 --> 00:07:32,025
the top it up and be swinging all over
the place and feel heavy

118
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,115
our hands which train again will be very
conscious the pen

119
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:40,082
itself designing a pen to have the right
diameter

120
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:43,088
for the right length seem like pretty
basic

121
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,163
an obvious things right yet there are
countless

122
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:52,722
pan and ap designs that failed because
their designers have lost sight

123
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,610
these fundamentals before we dive into
the say one more thing

124
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,070
which is that being intuitive not very
intuitive

125
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:07,068
actually pretty difficult to do you have
to understand the fact that you're not

126
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:08,150
designing just for yourself

127
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:12,036
you're designing for other people

128
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,134
and those people they don't know the
things that you know

129
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:20,043
and they frankly probably aren't as
passionate about your app

130
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:24,090
as you are so gonna tend to be a bit
impatient

131
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,148
easily frustrated fickle right

132
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,150
designing an intuitive interface is
impossible until you can

133
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:36,032
get out of your own head you need to
recognize your own assumptions about

134
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:36,561
things

135
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,935
about crew the people you're designing
for our what they're trying to

136
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,110
accomplish what they know what they
don't know

137
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:47,990
you need to see clearly need to hear
clearly

138
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,520
figure out what it is that you can do to
help them

139
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:56,151
succeed if you can do that you will have
done an amazing thing

140
00:08:57,051 --> 00:09:00,090
people appreciate the fact

141
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:05,688
the you cared enough to make a great
user experience so let's dive in

142
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,470
and find out the top five
characteristics are starting

143
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:15,066
with platform savvy let's go back to
pens again

144
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:18,113
you see this

145
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:22,112
particular pan but your I could have any
trouble writing with that because

146
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:27,027
you've used thousands and thousands the
Pens before and those

147
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:29,034
experiences writing with all those
different pens is giving you this

148
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:30,956
generalized understanding

149
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:35,310
how all pens work they have

150
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:38,068
shaped your expectations and they're
going to influence your behavior

151
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:42,070
and when you pick up that pen and you
write with it

152
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:45,092
Chernoff work like you expected it to
you

153
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:52,092
and if it didn't you become frustrated
when someone uses your app for the first

154
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:54,081
time

155
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:58,100
they do so with all sorts of
expectations about how it's supposed to

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,066
work

157
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,073
these expectations are forms

158
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:06,117
and affected by so many different
factors but the most important %uh those

159
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:10,126
is that individuals experience using
other

160
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,230
Iowa or Mac caps those could be ones
that

161
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:17,120
were built into the device when they
purchased it or they could be ones that

162
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:23,080
many have you here today have made for
them and let's to take a look at an

163
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:23,163
example

164
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:28,086
swiping a table row to reveal some
actions

165
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,565
in particular let's look at swiping a
table row to reveal some kind of the

166
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,400
week but in our trash but in

167
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,940
now we're all really familiar with the
and we first encountered it may be with

168
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:39,243
male

169
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,420
and we thought hey that's its kind in
the right I don't have to go open

170
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:47,118
the email to see the trash but in so
that I can delete it I have to go into

171
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:49,062
some kind edit mode

172
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:52,271
I could just use a gesture to delete it
right away

173
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:56,370
and after doing this a couple times well
you got into the habit

174
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:59,074
a vid started to learn to expect

175
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,080
this behavior this interaction

176
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:06,287
now you open notes for the very first
time never seen this before

177
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,390
and you know notes look a little bit
different from male but not completely

178
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,086
different

179
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:14,155
are some similarities like male
everything is arrayed in a scrollable

180
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,090
view

181
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,073
and there's the little gray lines that
separate them

182
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:25,333
and you know you figure that like email
messages notes could be deleted

183
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:31,270
so you think to yourself well I should
be able to swipe to reveal the delete

184
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,048
button

185
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:35,157
you don't even have to think about it
fact

186
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,990
probably don't you try

187
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:41,105
swiping to believe because unconsciously

188
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:46,072
you believe that it should work
intuitively you think it should work

189
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,093
and when it does you're rewarded with
the outcome that you

190
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:52,167
expected and if it did it you'd be
frustrated

191
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:56,135
you would say why did they not do that
make so much sense

192
00:11:57,035 --> 00:12:00,037
right you now have to get figure out how
your gonna delete

193
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:05,068
no swiping to delete is a platform
convention and it's among thousands and

194
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,103
thousands a different black

195
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:12,016
foreign conventions that i OS users have
come to expect

196
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:16,018
and not only do they expect swipe to
delete to work in whatever situation it

197
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,917
would make sense for it to work

198
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,280
they expect every aspect is that
generate I'm

199
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:25,090
interaction to match their previous
experience

200
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:29,067
from the center direct manipulation to
how far they need to drag the road to

201
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,053
reveal the bulletins

202
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:34,937
maybe even the color and the size of the
button itself

203
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:41,010
any deviations from these things no
matter how small or insignificant

204
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:44,056
could be incorrectly perceived by them
as being

205
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:49,093
meaningfully different or maybe they
just get this big sense that something's

206
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,097
not quite right

207
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:54,316
being consistent with platform
conventions in other words

208
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:59,050
is a very good thing gestures like pinch

209
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:04,011
swipe pan tap they should work in very
consistent ways no matter what type

210
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:07,074
ap views

211
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:11,101
same is true for control like switches
are buttons

212
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:15,038
for navigation bars tables

213
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:20,063
Tavarres and they're also powerful
conventions

214
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:25,085
about than labels that we used to convey
certain actions are the icons that we

215
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,304
use

216
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:31,050
now you this symbol may have not been
immediately familiar to you the first

217
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:32,039
time you saw it

218
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,358
but after you shared something a couple
of times he started to get a sense

219
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,722
what that symbol represents

220
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,670
you know a kind of functionality is
accessed by tapping

221
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:47,486
that but im and these conventions that
exist

222
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:53,010
police try less Mac are not at all
arbitrary

223
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:57,048
swiping to delete isn't just intuitive
because at the thousands and thousands

224
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:57,073
have

225
00:13:57,064 --> 00:14:00,623
outs that support that same exact
interaction

226
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,720
it's consistent are stark its at the
party that but it's not the whole story

227
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:07,041
its intuitive to us

228
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:11,698
because it's like the real-world
experiences that we all shared together

229
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:15,674
it's like crossing something of a list
are you know being a two-year-old

230
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,050
meeting

231
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:21,031
food and swiping out here where at you
don't want it anymore so you gonna swipe

232
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:23,430
to get rid of it

233
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,980
there's countless countless conventions
that exist

234
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,937
for any platform for which you're
designing and it's important to

235
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,856
recognize what those conventions are

236
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:37,350
because that's what people are going to
expect

237
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:40,062
sometimes it's necessary to break those
conventions

238
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:43,135
this is actually not that common but

239
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:47,066
maybe you're designing an app that's
never existed before

240
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:51,555
new typeof experience for you designing
for a new type reviews are new tapas

241
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,168
nari or context

242
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,344
maybe you're just trying to solve a
problem that we ate out baller

243
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,760
other you guys have never tried to solve
before right so there is no precedent

244
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:05,082
follow now if that's the case for you

245
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:09,411
you have a responsibility to tell people

246
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,161
to inform them that you have decided 22

247
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:18,160
something different with your app now
let's take a look at an example

248
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:21,101
this is Leo's fortune we saw that one
ADA yesterday

249
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:25,016
that we ought there on the wooden scale

250
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:28,255
as you can see there's only one button
on the screen the pause button

251
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,620
everything else is done through gestures

252
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:35,067
and these gestures their intuitive but
they're not standard they're not really

253
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:37,671
obvious

254
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:41,835
so the game provides instruction it
teaches you about them one at a time

255
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,550
you use your left arm to move left and
right so that it moves forward and

256
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:46,087
backwards

257
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:50,296
for you you swipe up your right thumb to
inflate Leo so that he can

258
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,170
hop over obstacles like this ledge

259
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:58,376
these are non-standard interactions and
the developers at this game

260
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,720
knew that they had to educate people
about them earl's

261
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:04,098
players would be confused and they would
become frustrated

262
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:07,101
quit and leave the game wouldn't be a
very good

263
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,099
experience for them now that all I'm
gonna say

264
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:14,147
when it comes on boarding and help today
because we have an entire

265
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:19,051
our dedicated to this topic it's a
really great presentation and I

266
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:19,161
encourage

267
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:23,125
everyone here to go Thursday

268
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,088
the mission see you there

269
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:30,144
the next characteristic have intuitive
user

270
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:35,813
interfaces as that there easy to
navigate

271
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,110
how intuitive navigation systems do
three things:

272
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:45,017
really well first they just tell you
where you are

273
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:49,366
the clock out with the tabbar does a
really good job at that

274
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,524
makes it perfectly clear what you're
lookin

275
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,470
and I'm sorry it's so low on the screen
I know their own cannot crane their

276
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,123
necks in order to see it

277
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:03,056
now out to use navigation bar and have a
title also do a really good job of

278
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,104
telling you where you are the title
serves that purpose

279
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:11,027
the next thing that they do is they show
you where else you could go

280
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:14,062
show you what your options are so the
phone app

281
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:17,351
began with the tab bar there's a very
good job it just means

282
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,961
having everything on screen invisible
pretty simple

283
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,560
and the third thing that they do is they
explain

284
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:27,078
what's there meeting

285
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,697
the navigation system informs you about
what's contained within each section you

286
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:33,424
don't have to go

287
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:37,370
to every single section to figure out
what's inside

288
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:40,059
let's take a step back for a second
right

289
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,101
why do we need navigation to begin with
we the navigation

290
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:48,034
because there's way too much information
and functionality

291
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:52,120
in any given out to display on screen at
one point in time

292
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:56,020
so we groupings together

293
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,129
make these categories or sections

294
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:04,056
and these categories we come up with
they need to be understandable

295
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:07,137
and logical to people who are using your
app

296
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:11,075
it shouldn't feel like a mystery what's
behind

297
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:15,984
for what's inside you to these category
labels

298
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,540
for the phone app succeeds because you
to these icons and labels that's used

299
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:25,183
makes the content inside is
self-explanatory meaning it

300
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,320
provides a good explanation of what
takes up key information or

301
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:30,049
functionality

302
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:35,146
is contained within each section out the
app

303
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:41,111
so in other words intuitive navigation
systems answer three basic questions

304
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:46,033
where Am I where else can I go

305
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:49,052
and what will I find when I get there

306
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:53,053
now these seem like really basic things
right everyone hears kinda sparking it's

307
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:53,094
like

308
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:58,073
totally obvious but it turns out that
designing a navigation system that can

309
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,994
accomplish these three things well

310
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,744
is pretty challenging to make so with
that in mind

311
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,010
have a few tips for you about how you
can make your navigation system

312
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:14,088
really intuitive starting with
progressive disclosure

313
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:17,088
now if you're not familiar with what
this term is

314
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:20,092
it's pretty simple it just means not
showing things to people until they

315
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:21,897
actually

316
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,700
need it now

317
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:29,226
you do that by kind of creating little
bit deeper hierarchy here

318
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,320
adding a few more steps in a process

319
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:36,040
the seems like it might take more time
to get to your destination

320
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:40,069
get the outcome that you're after but
it's worth it

321
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:44,147
because it makes decision making simple
and an intimidating at every stage in

322
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:46,075
the process

323
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:49,160
so all to me earlier able to get to your
destination more quickly

324
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:53,021
and more confidently unless that is

325
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:56,137
you use category names that aren't
logical

326
00:19:57,037 --> 00:20:01,055
are not meeting for so in this situation
if you're reading the

327
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:04,059
fly we're picking a mode of
transportation for getting from

328
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:07,060
one place to another and if we're doing
that

329
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:11,113
the first choice we have is do you wanna
go by air or do you wanna go by land

330
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:15,102
that makes a lot of sense right those
things are kinda mutually exclusive

331
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:17,035
choices

332
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:20,057
and these labels are pretty good because

333
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:23,122
gonna go by air we figure that 10 the
items

334
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:28,069
in that category is gonna be a choice to
go by airplane

335
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:33,788
or for going by land we're gonna have
options to go by car may be by rail

336
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:37,490
we don't know all the choices that are
contained inside we get

337
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,138
incoming we gonna understanding about
what things are contained within

338
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:45,132
now if we decide to go by land we get
the second choice

339
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:50,056
this is the disaster said i've labels
for us

340
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:53,395
now we can go take a motor
transportation that

341
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:57,973
uses fuel or doesn't use your now within
were thinking about

342
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:01,710
well all this okay card uses fuel

343
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:04,080
arm but if I wanna take train

344
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:08,077
that use your I mean

345
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:12,086
like steam power your her call

346
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:16,086
right what if it's electric but a fun
taking light rail

347
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:19,092
you know maybe that no filament
electricity but it could be solar

348
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,054
powered her

349
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:25,663
wind-powered a nuclear-powered instead
getting to where I want to go I'm asking

350
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:29,330
all these esoteric questions about the
nature

351
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:33,105
fuel and the meaning of that word right
these are not very good labels

352
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:38,052
that uncertainty is causing hesitation
and it's making me aware

353
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:41,661
up the interface itself and trying to
code it

354
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:45,450
again use progressive disclosure but
make sure

355
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:48,046
that it doesn't feel like you're trying
to figure out what's behind door number

356
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:51,015
three

357
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,830
now the next if I have is about being
predictable

358
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:58,134
everyone like surprises right except
when it comes to navigation

359
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:02,062
with navigation we do not like surprises

360
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:06,094
whenever addition changes on us
unexpectedly and in ways that we can

361
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:11,129
explain to rationalize we can get really
confused and tripped up

362
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,056
so let's take a look and how this can
happen

363
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:19,061
so let's say a word making a banking out
parade and we have a few choices

364
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:23,870
to select from and then once we register
and then login

365
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,310
is a few other sections that are added
so navigation is change but

366
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:33,130
I guess I can explain myself why things
changed in the way that they did

367
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,700
or maybe the bank decides they're gonna
add this awesome new feature giving away

368
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:37,012
free cash

369
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:42,053
right I wanna bank at this bank this is
a great feature

370
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,530
they put it right at the top because
they think their customers really gonna

371
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:45,244
love it

372
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,300
but then someone comes to their senses
and decides that they're not going to be

373
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:50,832
able to give away that feature

374
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,760
for free cash much longer so they
de-emphasize it may reduce its

375
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:54,955
visibility

376
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:59,691
in the west by pushing it to the bottom
so it's changed

377
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
for let's say we look to the analytics
and app and we've talked to

378
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:07,031
all the people who are using aid we
figured out that really people want to

379
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:07,123
go to

380
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:11,082
mostly to find location sir figure out
how to contact the bank so we move that

381
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,160
stuff to the top

382
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:16,084
now there's hundreds reasons why
navigation can change

383
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,045
some of them are good and some of them
are batter just terrible

384
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:24,061
who whatever the reason is there's
always this downside

385
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:27,152
retraining people on how to do something

386
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:31,201
that they're familiar with takes time
and it can be really frustrating for

387
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:32,530
people

388
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:35,332
may I think we all had this experience
where we've been going to like a website

389
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,340
or using app for a very long period of
time

390
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:41,373
and then it was redesigned and all of a
sudden we're thrown off

391
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,100
we have to study the interfaces figure
out where things went

392
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:48,820
to you we just been used to pressing the
red thing over there

393
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,970
right we weren't even reading the label
and now we have two study in

394
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,103
figure out where that went to even the
smallest changes can really true people

395
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:57,099
up

396
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:00,103
so by all means changer interface when
you need to

397
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:04,087
but you carefully and don't do it
frequently

398
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:07,092
now the next point is is really obvious

399
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:12,099
but it's worth talking about anyway and
that is that selection

400
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:16,187
needs to be immediately obvious I was
towel bars for example

401
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,161
we use color to show selection

402
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:25,510
and we also you shape so on left hand
side you can see sometimes icons get

403
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:26,970
filled then

404
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:30,098
and on the right side you can see that
sometimes they get bigger

405
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:33,160
now part the reason for this is that
makes it easier to show the selection

406
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,040
color see inflection color

407
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:41,095
but there's another reason for using a
thicker are filled in shape

408
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:45,124
let's take a look at the clock out again
now we can all see unless you're sitting

409
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:46,943
in the back

410
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,164
that the world clock is selected very
obvious right

411
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,350
let's say we didn't have enough time to
design a totally different set of icons

412
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:57,127
for the activists elected state

413
00:24:58,027 --> 00:25:01,676
so instead we just use of state

414
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,590
but we tend to the Red we put that into
the interface

415
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:10,101
all right off the bat you can see that
selection is a lot less obvious

416
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:14,086
and it's really not obvious if you're
colorblind

417
00:25:14,086 --> 00:25:18,089
just as a common practice something
always remember to do

418
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:21,170
take screenshots throughout bring them
into the graphic design tool your choice

419
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:26,038
Andy saturate them and make sure that
you can still clearly see state

420
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:30,920
and selection this is a really important
thing to do

421
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,960
with the filled in tab Rikon it still at
least possible

422
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:41,096
to see what selection if the color red
looks like great see you

423
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:50,053
see I and even if you can see every
color the spectrum just fine

424
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:53,625
using a field in shape make selection
more obvious

425
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,330
for all of us the case is doing the
right thing for accessibility improving

426
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,060
the experience

427
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:02,315
for everyone next

428
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,936
navigation systems that are intuitive
maximize continuity

429
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,700
now in the profession and worldview I
designed we use this word

430
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:14,046
flow all the time and all it really
means

431
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,065
is is the experience a moving from one
place

432
00:26:18,065 --> 00:26:21,204
to another one you to the next one state

433
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,260
two different staters section to a
different section

434
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:29,050
and the intuitive you it have occasion
system

435
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:33,010
is designed to minimize disruption to
maximize

436
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,289
a continuity by keeping people oriented

437
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:40,610
as they flow through the experience

438
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:44,095
so let's take an example with the photos
outcry West and here looking at a

439
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:45,136
greater photos

440
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:49,041
and wheat Apple one of those photos its
rooms up

441
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:53,148
fills the screen and this is really
important for usability because

442
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:57,367
without having to think about it you
know that

443
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,010
the photo you tapped on is the one that
you're now looking at

444
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:05,540
you get that instantaneous confirmation
again without having to think about it

445
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:09,010
and animations go back is just opposite

446
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:13,780
reversed and this is also important for
the usability the photos out

447
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:17,580
because now you're back in the GridView
and you know exactly which photo you're

448
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:19,777
just been looking out to you know how to
proceed forward

449
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:24,360
or backward from that specific photo

450
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:27,048
now this animation have been done
differently

451
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:32,065
instead we tapped on the photo and the
big bustling in from the right

452
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:35,133
we wouldn't have the benefit that
continuous experience

453
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:39,069
we would have to remember which with the
photo look like that we had one to look

454
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:39,668
at

455
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:44,327
and then compare it with the image we're
now looking at the same is true we go

456
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:45,682
back

457
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,824
with remember what that forward-looking
outlook like comparative

458
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:52,510
the photos in a gridview now this is a
very simple

459
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:55,139
you I animation concept but it's a
powerful one

460
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,428
and it's used in all sorts of different
I was out so we make

461
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,857
as well as on home screen itself

462
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,210
an what's more as we use it all over the
place I know it's 10

463
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:16,021
as well for the very same reasons

464
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:20,010
K

465
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:24,023
the next tip is about providing hence
provide hints to people

466
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:28,111
when they seem to be getting confused
this is the app sky guide

467
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:33,058
again also 188 yesterday and it provides

468
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:36,084
information about the entire universe
right you get to see

469
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:39,159
detailed information about beetlejuice
and countless other

470
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:43,077
solar bodies that exist now

471
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:47,086
you may think that the way you get that
information is just by tapping on a star

472
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:51,079
that's pretty logical that pretty
intuitive right

473
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,125
that's how you get information about
something and just about any out

474
00:28:55,025 --> 00:29:00,030
but if you thought that you would be 100
percent completely and totally wrong

475
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:04,046
the real way that you get information
about the stars by pressing the iPad and

476
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:05,166
over on the right hand side of the
screen

477
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:09,072
but that I but it was just sitting there
the whole time

478
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:12,099
well you wouldn't know that what it
represented you might think it's just

479
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:13,165
general information about the

480
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:17,077
app itself or you know like the cosmos

481
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:20,170
red so to clarify that for people

482
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:25,048
sky guide is a couple a very simple
things with animation to help you out

483
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:30,026
when you select a star when you select

484
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:34,041
star I but in fades in and opposes a
little bit

485
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:37,105
straws your attention to it when you
deflect the star

486
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:42,072
just fades out and that gives you

487
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,084
this understanding that there is a
relationship between star the have

488
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,141
selected an Info button

489
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:51,139
very effective very subtle I mean you're
not necessarily even thinking about that

490
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:55,055
and what's even cooler than that is it

491
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:59,087
if you happen to think that double
tapping a star also give you information

492
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:00,110
about the starr

493
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:04,020
as I did than I but in

494
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:07,124
with the key poor thing every time we
tap on that starr so it's elegantly

495
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:09,099
redirecting your attention

496
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,112
back over to the eye but in because they
can %uh for

497
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:16,094
in for by how you're interacting with
the app that that's what your intention

498
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:17,135
is to get information about

499
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:21,067
star and there's retraining you
redirecting

500
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:24,126
K and the last

501
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:29,059
and probably most important if that I
have is that

502
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:33,153
less is more picking between a smaller
number of choices

503
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:37,128
it's faster and easier then picking from
a larger number

504
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:41,102
choices told you it's a lot I really don
obvious things

505
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:47,026
giving people too many choices can slow
them down and it can be intimidating

506
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:50,118
you might think that your impressing
people who are using your out with

507
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,099
health feature richer out this

508
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:56,121
but there take way may be very different
they may think that you're out this too

509
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,072
much for their needs are just too
intimidating

510
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,095
we see a long list

511
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:05,163
like this we all know this we start to
skim over things

512
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:09,081
but wanted to spend hours and hours
looking at this hour

513
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:13,102
so we're just gonna glanced down really
quickly but when we do that

514
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:19,035
inevitably we wind up skipping over
things and the things we skip over

515
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:22,092
may very well have been the things that
we wanted to select

516
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:26,130
which means if we're skipping over the
stuff we want to select

517
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:31,058
the people who are using your app for
not getting what they want out of it

518
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:36,131
they're not realizing your app's for
potential and if you can't limit the

519
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:39,069
number of choices they are offering to
people

520
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:42,094
again use progressive disclosure

521
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:46,102
to help keep decision making simple and
an intimidating at every step in the

522
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:50,011
process now

523
00:31:50,011 --> 00:31:53,023
that a lot about navigation

524
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:56,032
and I promise I'm gonna talk about other
things but I feel like I would be

525
00:31:57,013 --> 00:32:01,017
remit if I didn't use this opportunity
to talk with you

526
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:08,017
about hamburger menus AK

527
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:13,171
flight out menus AKA sidebars

528
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:17,137
AKA basement AKA drawers

529
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:22,099
now these controls are very common

530
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:28,108
on i OS and on other platforms and I'm
sure many view here work on abs that

531
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,031
have been seen

532
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,128
you guys made the decision to put in
your app and I'm sure that you did so

533
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:37,097
with the very best of intentions

534
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:42,183
and I will say that these controls do a
couple things very well

535
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:46,130
for one thing they save space

536
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:51,041
so rather than taking up a bunch a room
at the bottom of the screen for a tabbar

537
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:56,109
just taking up a little bit area on the
top left corner for the hamburger menu

538
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,097
and you practically have the entire
height

539
00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:03,121
the screen to show options to people

540
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:08,055
and if that's not enough gonna cram more
awesomeness NT rap

541
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:14,126
people can scroll right

542
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:22,026
but

543
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:27,076
this is

544
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:30,125
I actually haven't played around the
latest version of Xcode I really hope

545
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,052
that they haven't changed this

546
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:37,086
I don't believe you'll find a hamburger
menu controller and side effects go

547
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:41,149
now typically we don't provide design
advice about the things that we don't

548
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:42,121
offer

549
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,057
to you guys but I can't help myself
right I've had so many conversations

550
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:48,155
with people about this control

551
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:52,120
many hours and hours and hours talking
about it and

552
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:56,089
you know I think it's important that we
talk about it here today and again I'm

553
00:33:57,007 --> 00:34:00,046
not gonna say that there is no place for
these controls categorically

554
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:04,075
I think there are some maps that could
maybe use one but I will say that their

555
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,111
value is greatly overstated

556
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,049
and they have huge usability downsides
to

557
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:15,728
remember the three key things about an
intuitive navigation system

558
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:19,950
that they tell you where you are and the
show you where else you can go

559
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:22,150
hamburger menus are terrible at both
those things

560
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:26,050
because the menu is not on the screen
it's not visible

561
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:30,110
only the button to display the menu is
and in practice

562
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:37,006
talking to developers they found the
South themselves that people user app

563
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:40,294
don't switch to different sections very
frequently

564
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,370
when they use this menu and the reason
for that is because the people who use

565
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:45,102
their app

566
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:51,020
don't know where else they can go right
they don't know because they can see the

567
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:53,040
options are maybe they sought at one
point in time

568
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:58,063
but they have since forgotten and if you
use this control you have to recognize

569
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:58,146
that

570
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:03,101
the people who use your out may not
realize the full potential of your app

571
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:08,058
hamburger menus are also just tedious

572
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:12,112
right if you want to switch sections
from the Account tab

573
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:16,095
to the transfers tab all you need to do
tap the button

574
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:20,099
and you're there instantly and if you
want to go back you tap that counts but

575
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:20,151
in

576
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,142
and your back where you started from
doing the same thing with the hamburger

577
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:25,099
menu

578
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:29,172
involves opening the menu waiting for
the animation to finish

579
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:33,167
reorienting yourself finding the option
you're interested in

580
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:37,095
tapping that and then waiting for that
mission complete getting back to where

581
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:37,183
you were before

582
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:41,105
and if you want to go back you have to
open the menu again

583
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:45,011
go through the whole process and there

584
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:49,016
you are again it takes at least twice as
many tops

585
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:53,038
to change sections something that should
be very busy in fluid

586
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:57,083
is made more difficult and the other
thing the hamburger many is quite

587
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:57,147
frankly

588
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:02,109
too badly as they don't play nicely with
back buttons

589
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:08,015
right I seen it for what back buttons
are supposed to go in that top left

590
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,166
corner position

591
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:12,075
but instead is hamburger many there so
people put the back button right next to

592
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:13,059
it

593
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:16,102
but no longer does this look like a back
button in anymore

594
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:22,066
it just looks like an arrow is pointing
to the hamburger menu looks ridiculous

595
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:25,068
and some participants

596
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:28,161
sometimes people recognize that the
looks ridiculous so when you drill down

597
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,079
into the hierarchy have an app

598
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,133
hamburger menu goes away now it takes

599
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:38,077
even more steps to switch to a different
section

600
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:41,080
you have to go back up enough times to
get to a level higher

601
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:45,089
even out to get to a view that contains
the hamburger menu

602
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:49,175
and sometimes people try to solve this
by putting the menu on the right hand

603
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:50,129
side

604
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:54,114
but that's not advisable either that
location

605
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:59,026
is a really important location usually
you can put some kinda action there

606
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:03,034
you know like a a plus sign to add
something or an headed by then

607
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:07,038
and finally

608
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:10,097
the downside being able to show a lot of
options

609
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:15,129
is that you can show a lot of options is
that you will show a lot of options

610
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:19,082
the potential for bloat and misuse

611
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:25,084
is tremendous they allow you to add
offer to stop that your users don't

612
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:28,087
really care about like

613
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:32,136
information about the app for version
history or credit

614
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:40,036
I hate to break it to you but no one
cares

615
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:46,106
and the other thing

616
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:50,093
the people wind up taking ads and
special offers

617
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:53,142
and making them look just like regular
sections and putting it in there too

618
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,067
that sucks on one side either

619
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:01,134
look jurors have any kind have a nasty
tendency

620
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:05,085
to fill with choc K

621
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:12,085
let's move on

622
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:17,111
thank you okay the next major
characteristic intuitive navigation

623
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:19,083
system are supported

624
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:23,083
we're not talking about navigation
intuitive user interfaces

625
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:26,141
is that they are clear now this applies

626
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:31,099
to the information aP's present and the
functionality that they present

627
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:35,108
information functionality need to be
straightforward and understandable

628
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:40,022
easy for people to do things are not
trying to decoder interpret what it is

629
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:40,093
they're saying

630
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:43,782
and clarity is very broad but very
powerful concept

631
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:48,170
just about everything I said about
navigation

632
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:52,098
really boils down to just being clear is
it clear where you are

633
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:56,157
is a clear world you can go is a clear
what happened information or functions

634
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:58,103
you'll find when you get there

635
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,052
the clarity applies to so much more than
just navigation

636
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:07,085
I would start with language obviously

637
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:10,172
we rely heavily upon the written word to
communicate with the people who use our

638
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:11,721
up

639
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:15,700
but how well do they understand what
we're saying

640
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:18,094
it turns out that that's a really hard
question for us to answer

641
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:23,082
and it's especially hard answer that
question before they've even had a

642
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:23,128
chance

643
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,035
to use the app but there are a few
things that

644
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,146
you can do to increase the likelihood
that you're speaking

645
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:34,134
and communicating as clearly as possible
here are

646
00:39:35,034 --> 00:39:39,070
Sixways you can be sure you're being as
clear as possible

647
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:42,042
starting with using

648
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:48,030
simple words now if you're designing it
out for a large number of people

649
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:51,101
avoid using big words that people may
have trouble understanding

650
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:55,124
so here's to you this red circle

651
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:59,063
that represents your vocabulary now

652
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,144
you use words for your vocabulary to
write the tax that you're gonna put in

653
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:04,058
your app's interface

654
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:07,837
and that's great wall you're developing
it but want to ship

655
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:13,720
long come some other people and their
vocabularies are different than your own

656
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:16,147
they may not be native speakers have
your angle language

657
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:21,059
they may have different educational
backgrounds whatever the reason it

658
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,067
doesn't really matter

659
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:26,088
the the bottom line is that the number
of words you share in common

660
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:30,130
is limited so use simpler words that
most people

661
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:35,047
will understand most to the time those
words they may not be as

662
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:39,108
precise for descriptive as you would
like them to be but it's gonna make it

663
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:45,046
easier for more people to enjoy you're
out the next step

664
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:49,131
is to avoid jargon people shouldn't need
to be computer scientist to

665
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:55,034
use an app so for example we say
airplane mode on

666
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:58,046
we want a turnoff radios now turn of

667
00:40:58,046 --> 00:41:01,046
radios those are really basic words but

668
00:41:01,046 --> 00:41:04,097
most people don't understand your radios
means in this context they just think

669
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:05,190
it's like and from radio they have in
their house

670
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:09,103
so we use airplane mode much more
effective

671
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:14,167
and this isn't just about computer
mumbo-jumbo have come about everything

672
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:18,139
so let's just say we're making an app
about renewable energy

673
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,106
and this app is intended to be used by
people who own

674
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:26,815
houses are our office buildings or what
have you and your interested in doing

675
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:28,650
the right thing for the environment or

676
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:32,100
to saving money they're not necessarily
really well informed about all the

677
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,002
technology is

678
00:41:34,002 --> 00:41:38,069
that they can choose from now they
shouldn't need to know

679
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:44,083
what a photovoltaic module is they're
gonna say solar panels right

680
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:48,124
it'll take 10 right

681
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:52,068
a better design is one that

682
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:55,074
leads with solar panels leads with the
commonplace term

683
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:59,055
and if you wanted to find it for people

684
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:02,102
that's great your educating them right
welds

685
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:06,093
kinda synonymous with photovoltaic
modules so now when that individual go

686
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:08,125
somewhere else and they see that term or
they're gonna know

687
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:12,084
what it means but there is a

688
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:17,084
have a qualification here and that is
that it's critical to know

689
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:22,098
your audience so in this scenario we
were designing af which is targeted

690
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:26,477
at a consumer at someone with a the
large audience the people who are

691
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,390
described right

692
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,092
and we don't know what they with a No

693
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:33,167
and they probably can't take anything
for granted so we want to use the term

694
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:35,073
like solar panels

695
00:42:36,027 --> 00:42:39,045
but imagine we're designing an app which
was to be used by

696
00:42:39,045 --> 00:42:44,063
the technicians the people who install
solar panels in people's homes

697
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:47,134
well they're probably gonna be a lot
better informed about the technology

698
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:50,108
maybe they intuitively are just
naturally would use the word

699
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:52,013
photovoltaic modules

700
00:42:52,058 --> 00:42:55,140
more precise in fact they would be
embarrassed to use an app

701
00:42:56,004 --> 00:42:59,073
which says solar panels that will work
Honeycutt that'd be plucked out by their

702
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:01,098
colleagues

703
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:05,180
so think about you're out now there's
there's a spectrum

704
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:11,012
it's important to consider retarding at
targeting a consumer or professional

705
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:15,047
correctly positioning your app on that
spectrum

706
00:43:15,065 --> 00:43:18,116
is the key to making sure that you're
out

707
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:23,071
is intuitive for the audience who's
using it

708
00:43:23,071 --> 00:43:27,080
now the next step is about being
descriptive

709
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:30,047
so sometimes I see that was an option
that says

710
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:35,068
home well what's on the home screen I
have no idea

711
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:38,155
home is very under scripted in fact

712
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:43,063
it always suggest to be that person
design out probably comes from web

713
00:43:43,063 --> 00:43:44,104
design background

714
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:48,025
when I and I'll West we try to be really
descriptive

715
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:52,050
about what kinda content or
functionality you find on that screen

716
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:56,037
to use better words they're more
descriptive

717
00:43:56,082 --> 00:43:59,163
and next be succinct

718
00:44:00,063 --> 00:44:03,145
brevity is a virtue neck

719
00:44:04,045 --> 00:44:11,045
avoid truncation

720
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:15,131
it's really hard to read text when it's
not all visible on the screen at one

721
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:18,074
point in time

722
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:23,153
being succinct and using shorter words
will help

723
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:28,054
and finally you could have the best
coffee in the whole world

724
00:44:28,054 --> 00:44:31,102
I mean beautiful prose but won't do you
much good

725
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:36,005
if people are having a hard time reading
it so use a typeface

726
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:41,069
which is legible and make sure that text
is large enough for people to read

727
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:44,076
at a comfortable viewing distance now
they're peace

728
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:47,155
pressed against the device for the
computer screen

729
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:52,070
and if you're making an Iowa sap a
highly recommends that you use dynamic

730
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:53,008
type

731
00:44:53,008 --> 00:44:57,013
this will pretty much assure that text
is going to be as legible as are built

732
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:58,118
in APs

733
00:44:59,018 --> 00:45:03,022
and for those people who have a hard
time reading about I say

734
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:06,067
well they can adjust font size to suit
their individual

735
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:10,106
needs just as important

736
00:45:11,006 --> 00:45:14,099
as speaking clearly with words is
communicating clearly

737
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:17,197
with visual symbol in fact a
well-designed icon

738
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:21,195
can often communicate a concept more
quickly and more effectively

739
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:27,147
than any word can but icons are really
tricky to get right

740
00:45:28,047 --> 00:45:31,065
I mean what is this icon mean right
means nothing

741
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:35,078
made by the saw this so we think maybe
it's like a beach ball floating in a

742
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:35,173
fish tank

743
00:45:36,073 --> 00:45:40,129
or its addition a dish rack or it's like
a super modern

744
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:45,085
door knocker I without any contact I
have no idea what this means

745
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:48,157
this is terrible icon so what kinda
icons

746
00:45:49,057 --> 00:45:53,066
will work well well there's some icons

747
00:45:53,066 --> 00:45:56,157
which are successful because they're
internationally recognizable

748
00:45:57,057 --> 00:46:02,115
such as this information sign we've seen
information signs in museums

749
00:46:03,015 --> 00:46:07,021
in mall and airports and we always know
what they mean it means getting

750
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:10,039
information about something

751
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:15,008
next their symbols which are so
pervasive we used in so many types about

752
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,520
like this magnifying glass we understand
what its trying to tell us

753
00:46:19,052 --> 00:46:22,083
we know that this relates to searching

754
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:27,114
even if the particular format searching
may vary

755
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:31,096
and next there's icon that are
successful because

756
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:35,133
they represent these real ordinary
commonplace objects that we've

757
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:42,072
all used in our lives we've all own an
alarm clock or we've only seen one on TV

758
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:46,200
so when we see this icon that looks like
an alarm clock we know what it's trying

759
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:48,077
to communicate to us

760
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:52,166
so let's put this around a bit what
types of icons don't work well

761
00:46:53,066 --> 00:46:56,079
well if your icon need to label

762
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,144
in order to be understandable that's a
really bad sign

763
00:47:01,044 --> 00:47:05,049
if your icon represent a commonplace
objects that

764
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:09,131
many people have never seen in their
life

765
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:16,073
at the that's a problem

766
00:47:16,073 --> 00:47:19,432
and if you use a really common icon but

767
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:24,300
in a very non-standard unconventional
way

768
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:28,078
then it's time the go back to the
drawing board and start over

769
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:33,314
and also if you ever catch yourself for
someone around you

770
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,510
says well I may not be perfectly clear
but people will learn what it means

771
00:47:37,051 --> 00:47:38,650
eventually

772
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:43,740
then I'd like all a few people to meet
me over here after because I had

773
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:46,148
awesome bridge very much like to sell
you

774
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:51,099
ok it's not that i Kant can spew learned
it's just that they're not likely to be

775
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,130
learned

776
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:57,074
why would I find out what an icon does I
don't know what it means but even tap on

777
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,033
it or cook it

778
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:02,088
maybe it's going to do something
destructive and anyway that's a really

779
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,112
low bar to set for yourself

780
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:09,031
if you wanna make truly intuitive ap
don't settle for icons

781
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:12,580
that mean to be learned

782
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:16,010
and also want to mention that icons are
often used

783
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:19,085
because space is limited to they wind up
being

784
00:48:19,085 --> 00:48:22,094
kinda small to what they were making

785
00:48:23,075 --> 00:48:26,090
an icon above a coffee cup

786
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:29,718
we were making it we're using like a
vector design tool

787
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:35,655
have resumed and 2 30 to 100 percent and
want to really get creative with their

788
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:39,080
so yet coffee but you know it's hot
coffee

789
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:42,049
organ at a little bit of steam and we
want people to know that if they happen

790
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:44,052
to tip the coffee cups gonna be okay

791
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:47,101
because as a saucer which will catch all
the coffee and

792
00:48:47,569 --> 00:48:50,870
you know who likes boring Blake Miller
coffee

793
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:54,576
mugs right Delfina pictures logo is on
them in coffee makes us happy so let's

794
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,290
put a happy face on it

795
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:01,095
but then when you display at the correct
resolution

796
00:49:01,095 --> 00:49:06,146
all that detail gets kinda lost becomes
muddy

797
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:11,104
so don't know how all those details it's
better to render the same simple

798
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:15,010
symbol but with less visual detail

799
00:49:15,001 --> 00:49:19,097
will be far more clear when it's
downsized the crack resolution

800
00:49:20,006 --> 00:49:25,051
and if that doesn't work just try using
a different symbol altogether

801
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:29,123
look it's not always that easy to come
up with a great icon

802
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:33,040
if you can't find a visual symbol whose
meaning is

803
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:37,069
universally immediately and clearly
understood

804
00:49:38,005 --> 00:49:43,294
and just stick with text

805
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:47,190
now pictures and words these are really
key in important ways communicating

806
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:50,047
information but there's another tool

807
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:53,110
in the toolbox that I'd like to talk
with you about today

808
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:58,007
and that animation animation can
sometimes communicate things far more

809
00:49:58,007 --> 00:49:58,081
clearly

810
00:49:59,044 --> 00:50:02,143
then other words or pictures one of my
favorite examples

811
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:06,138
this is the focus and exposure indicator
in the camera app

812
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:11,099
this animation the focus and exposure
indicator this 3 really critical things

813
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:12,135
very well

814
00:50:13,035 --> 00:50:17,087
first but first appearing in scaling
down it's drawing your attention to the

815
00:50:17,087 --> 00:50:19,151
object to the part the image which is
being used

816
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:23,055
to determine the correct focus and
exposure

817
00:50:23,091 --> 00:50:27,169
because it's getting smaller its giving
you this hits that it's really precise

818
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:33,073
I'd zeroing in on a particular area and
then when it starts getting smaller

819
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:36,164
it just posted twice which tells you
that focus and exposure

820
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:40,119
have been locked and then it simply

821
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:45,113
fades away which tells you that that
process is complete and it's now okay

822
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:47,014
for you to take

823
00:50:47,023 --> 00:50:50,122
your photo ready

824
00:50:51,022 --> 00:50:54,120
set and go

825
00:50:55,002 --> 00:50:58,044
that a lot information contained in a
very quick

826
00:50:58,062 --> 00:51:03,090
and simple animation let's look at
another example

827
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:07,072
animation when you key in the wrong
passcode on your lock screen

828
00:51:08,053 --> 00:51:11,150
without saying a single word two shakes
head no

829
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:15,074
that's not the right answer and a clear
out that your procedure centered and let

830
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:19,042
you try again

831
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,070
okay to the second to last

832
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:25,056
major characteristic have intuitive user
interfaces

833
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:30,056
is that their simple

834
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:33,057
now the common element have not
overwhelming people with too many

835
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:33,765
options

836
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:39,100
any one point in time for using more
basic language to communicate with

837
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:40,079
people

838
00:51:40,088 --> 00:51:45,067
for reducing extraneous visual or
limitations from icon

839
00:51:45,859 --> 00:51:48,880
is that the user interface in the user
experience

840
00:51:48,088 --> 00:51:54,115
needs to be simple let's go back to that
pen and paper Knology for a second

841
00:51:55,015 --> 00:51:58,474
remember you were in your kitchen and
you were frantically hunting around for

842
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:01,260
a way to write down that phone number

843
00:52:01,026 --> 00:52:04,117
and let's just say that just like before
the pen was sitting there in the pad of

844
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:05,099
paper

845
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,117
sitting there on your kitchen table

846
00:52:09,017 --> 00:52:14,031
but there is also some piece in the
paper and there is also some dishes

847
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:17,097
and their kids toys that pen could be

848
00:52:17,097 --> 00:52:20,149
right there but you don't see it because
they're all these other objects which

849
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:23,102
are demanding your attention

850
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:29,080
complex out are like this in order to do
the most basic and simple things

851
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:33,099
you have to wade through a bunch of
things that you don't care about

852
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:37,142
simple out take the 80/20 rule to heart

853
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:41,074
as a lot of definitions for what the 82
20 rule means

854
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:45,074
one which is that eighty percent of
people are only going to use 20 percent

855
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:49,077
features for that eighty percent of the
time people are only gonna use 20

856
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:53,323
percent of the capabilities have any
given system

857
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,010
however you define it the it's pretty
simple

858
00:52:57,001 --> 00:53:03,027
most of the time most people use very
little what you actually make

859
00:53:03,027 --> 00:53:07,063
however you define it the takeaways this
if you show people information

860
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:10,066
that they don't care about our functions
they don't need

861
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:13,113
then it's all that stuff is just gonna
distract them

862
00:53:14,013 --> 00:53:17,972
no getting their way and make it harder
for them to accomplish what it is

863
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:22,620
they want to do now I've been showing a
lot of my with examples here and I i

864
00:53:22,062 --> 00:53:24,099
wanna talk about Mac per second and the
context

865
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:28,102
simplicity

866
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:34,039
now with the simplicity mean for Mac I
me max a very different than i OS

867
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:39,046
right me for one thing the screens are
much larger than iPad let alone an

868
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:40,078
iPhone's

869
00:53:40,078 --> 00:53:44,887
so there's a lot of room to show all
sorts of controls and information

870
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:49,300
and a lot of times that's what people
really want mean if you're designing a

871
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:51,061
professional application

872
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:54,135
that's a good thing right Mac for all
about utility

873
00:53:55,035 --> 00:53:58,044
and power sumac

874
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:00,115
that are designed for professionals take
advantage of this by offering

875
00:54:01,015 --> 00:54:04,048
sophisticated and advanced workflows

876
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:08,079
and people use the zaps for really
extended periods of time

877
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,171
and as they do so they become
comfortable managing all that complexity

878
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:17,160
and when they become comfortable
managing complexity other concerns come

879
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:18,093
to the fore

880
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,070
such as being efficient and efficiency
is all about availability meaning that

881
00:54:23,007 --> 00:54:24,100
everything is in plain sight

882
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:28,067
within reach to ca

883
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:32,006
so that's a good thing actually

884
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:36,065
but still keep in mind that if you're
not just designing for professionals but

885
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,104
a wider range of people maybe people who

886
00:54:39,004 --> 00:54:43,052
are just went to pick up new skills and
grow into that profession

887
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:47,351
just new users are trying to learn the
system you don't wanna drop them into

888
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,824
something that looks like this

889
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,740
take the time to give them their and
allow them to graduate to something

890
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:58,125
it's more complicated

891
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:04,039
now finally the number one
characteristic

892
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:07,045
and that's corny have intuitive user
interfaces

893
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:10,187
is that they are focused

894
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:14,103
now the designer this Penn is successful

895
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:19,096
because it's perfectly suited for the
context for which he was made

896
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:22,175
it's a general-purpose writing tool that
works well in your home or in your

897
00:55:23,075 --> 00:55:24,644
office

898
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:28,344
there's nothing about this and that's
extraneous

899
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:32,470
it's not me more complicated by features
that people don't really need

900
00:55:32,047 --> 00:55:37,060
all that often just serves basic writing
tasks

901
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:40,009
there's no ability to change the color
of the pan

902
00:55:40,009 --> 00:55:43,062
it's not double sided in case once I
breaks down

903
00:55:44,043 --> 00:55:47,114
doesn't have any kind Elise are pointing
capability

904
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:53,015
all those features would make this pen
needlessly complicated

905
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:57,704
the designer's pen is a very Cingular
and focus purpose

906
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,500
every aspect to dispense designed serves
that goal

907
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:06,021
it's for invites us to pick it up and to
hold it comfortably with

908
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:09,114
a couple of fingers it obvious how to

909
00:56:10,014 --> 00:56:13,022
click open the Penticton quickly closed
again

910
00:56:13,022 --> 00:56:16,024
by pressing on the button at the top

911
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:19,031
it's obvious how to clip it to a shirt
pocket or a piece a paper so that it's

912
00:56:19,094 --> 00:56:22,173
portable we can take it with us

913
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:28,099
in other words its intuitive because the
intense focus on supporting

914
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:31,115
just a couple have basic tasks like
writing and drawing and

915
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:35,474
thing portable it is uncomplicated

916
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:40,614
and therefore it is made intuitive to a
wide range of people and a wide variety

917
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:44,830
have contacts the focus can also mean

918
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:47,094
designing to support very specialized
turn

919
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:51,122
Neish applications this calligraphy pen

920
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:56,871
is intuitive to a calligrapher
everything about it they understand it

921
00:56:57,069 --> 00:56:58,630
makes total sense to them

922
00:56:58,063 --> 00:57:01,147
me the shape and never pen

923
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:05,606
but if you're not a clicker for and you
pick this up you try to write with it as

924
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:07,710
you would think to intuitively

925
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:11,117
as you would write with a pen the
results are gonna be pretty ugly

926
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:16,416
you can have a lot of flashes and walls
in the paper the writing on

927
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:20,667
the paper us the same thing this is
intuitive to a painter

928
00:57:21,549 --> 00:57:25,640
but here not a painter you're gonna make
a mess

929
00:57:25,064 --> 00:57:30,100
the designer these tools is optimized
for very specialized applications

930
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,589
and just like a pen adding any extra
star

931
00:57:34,589 --> 00:57:38,230
will result in a less successful and
less intuitive

932
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:41,117
design

933
00:57:42,017 --> 00:57:46,022
the beauty a bio s is that there are
hundreds of thousands I mean

934
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:49,736
1.2 million aP's out there

935
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:54,240
and many of the most successful out are
successful

936
00:57:54,024 --> 00:57:59,096
because they to just one or two things
extraordinarily well

937
00:57:59,096 --> 00:58:02,139
in other words they were designed around
clear and singular

938
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,065
purpose

939
00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:11,110
focuses means that your app can and
probably should

940
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:15,010
do less if you're out does less

941
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:19,021
you have more time to iterate to
prototype

942
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:23,340
to implement polish contest if Europe
does last

943
00:58:23,529 --> 00:58:27,770
you're gonna have less need for
complicated navigation controls that are

944
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:28,108
difficult to use

945
00:58:29,008 --> 00:58:34,023
and you

946
00:58:34,023 --> 00:58:37,121
if you're out does less you can spend
more time crafting

947
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:41,076
just the right wording are picking just
the right icons

948
00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:45,101
and making sure that you have time to
build and animations that clearly

949
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:49,076
and meaningfully provide user feedback
and help people to stay

950
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:53,095
oriented

951
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:56,504
a summer the best UI design advice

952
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,380
I ever received was that the

953
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:05,010
great software starts small

954
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:08,016
you pick something that you really
passionate about

955
00:59:08,016 --> 00:59:12,114
and is important to real people and you
try to figure out what it is that you

956
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:14,014
can do

957
00:59:14,014 --> 00:59:17,047
to help make things in their life better
easier

958
00:59:17,047 --> 00:59:22,916
faster more fun more delightful

959
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:26,339
and then you dive in

960
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:30,670
and you make that happen and you don't
ship and tell you how something that is

961
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,083
truly great

962
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:35,141
you don't ship until you have something
that you can

963
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:40,660
and should feel proud a

964
00:59:41,029 --> 00:59:44,200
if you've accomplished that your app

965
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:48,053
will become indispensable people want to
read it

966
00:59:48,071 --> 00:59:52,133
because the function it provides them
perfectly suits their needs

967
00:59:53,033 --> 00:59:56,089
exactly what they want and the former
the app

968
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:59,181
how it's been designed perfectly matches
the functionality

969
01:00:00,081 --> 01:00:03,137
that it offers to them and perhaps

970
01:00:04,037 --> 01:00:08,040
most importantly people will sense

971
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:11,022
the care the attention to detail

972
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:14,104
and the love that went into making a
truly great

973
01:00:15,004 --> 01:00:18,102
and truly intuitive ap

974
01:00:19,002 --> 01:00:24,004
cat so thank you are I want to point out
really quickly

975
01:00:24,022 --> 01:00:26,120
if you want to continue this
conversation here's my email address we

976
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,074
also have a lot really great design
resources

977
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:33,095
you available and developer to Apple
dock on including links to the Human

978
01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:34,214
Interface Guidelines

979
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:39,142
a bunch of videos we also be the I was
Human Interface Guidelines available as

980
01:00:39,799 --> 01:00:40,600
an iBook

981
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:44,006
you can go out to get that and also want
to point out that this is not

982
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:48,100
the last session about design with three
other really great sessions for you

983
01:00:49,054 --> 01:00:52,054
this year are you talking about last one
there on the left

984
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:55,103
go check it out if you do in app
purchase we have a

985
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:58,612
really good session with tons of great
wise and

986
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:02,100
content for you to follow and then this
session in the middle

987
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:05,054
is awesome it's about prototyping how we
use it out for

988
01:01:05,063 --> 01:01:09,732
to develop ideas and really refined and
figure out what it is you want to do

989
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,770
thank you very much for your time and
have a great evening
