1
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,350
good afternoon

2
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:18,081
welcome

3
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:21,088
son Patrick einen am a manager in the
air cocoa frameworks group

4
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,151
and welcome to adapting to the new UI
voz tenuous amity

5
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,136
let's get started so I

6
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:33,040
your family your house so it brings a
pretty fresh look to the Mac be astute

7
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,086
observers among you might have noticed
there's been some changes in the visual

8
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:36,079
department

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,148
well were here to help you understand

10
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:43,053
what has changed NY so to break it all
down for you

11
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:46,115
walked through it and to get a better
understanding a bit and then most most

12
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:47,094
importantly

13
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:51,147
I how to get the most out over this new
you why in your cocoa applications

14
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:55,108
so how are we gonna do this well

15
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:59,837
first we're going to talk about some
phenomenal design principles that went

16
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:00,970
into the choices

17
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:03,286
that resulted in the current design that
you see in Austin yosemite

18
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,010
I then we're gonna take it into the tour
bus

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,090
and I just take a tour love of your
family in all the key pieces

20
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,090
that have changed but our relevance for
Coco app developers from developers

21
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:15,145
point of view

22
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:20,118
then we're gonna talk about vibrancy
which is one of these important elements

23
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:24,087
I am just deconstruct that you can get a
conceptual basis for understanding how

24
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,183
what role it plays and how it works and
what it does for you

25
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:32,112
then talk about some elements that you
might bring to your applications fonts

26
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:36,045
colors are working how they should how
they know what their role is now some

27
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,133
things we've done to make working with
them

28
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:42,128
easier I in in your Sammy and last but
definitely not least we'll talk about

29
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:45,042
app compatibility in how to mitigate

30
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:48,128
are the risk introducing this big design
change in having a nap work

31
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:54,054
across different scenarios okay so with
that i'm gonna hand it over to my

32
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:55,108
colleague morning get right into

33
00:01:56,008 --> 00:02:00,030
the design portion stock Mike

34
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:07,003
thank you Patrick hi everyone saw Mike
Stern I'm

35
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,073
user experience evangelist without Paul
and

36
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:14,297
I I'm not an engineer I'm a designer

37
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,515
so what am I doing here at this
engineering session well we're talking

38
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:18,970
about the new design

39
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,184
voters 10 and I thought I would just
come here for a few minutes to talk

40
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:24,111
about some other high-level principles
are design teams that

41
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:29,030
guided and inspired the design OS 10
yosemite

42
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:32,066
now yesterday we announced I was 10 your
sanity

43
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:36,098
and the most innocent is the 10th

44
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:41,100
police 2000 s10 and in that time span

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,066
there's been a few really major you I
releases for OS 10

46
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,103
and as with every one of those releases

47
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,007
elements like the menu bar Windows

48
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:57,122
the doc have been refined

49
00:02:58,022 --> 00:03:01,038
to be friendlier easier to use

50
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:04,367
more approachable but they've also been

51
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,520
redesigned to have greater utility power
and support more sophisticated

52
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:14,110
and advanced workflows you send it is
just another step in a continuous

53
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:15,089
process

54
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:21,105
evolving OS 10 let's dive in and talk
about some the principles that

55
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:26,017
really core to this particular redefine
the first one

56
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:29,113
its simplicity let's take a look at
these app icons

57
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:33,097
in particular

58
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:36,186
let's look at the calendar icon as
before

59
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:41,179
calendar was redesigned but it still
very much looks like a realistic

60
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,131
three-dimensional object

61
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:47,050
with realistic highlights realistic
shadows

62
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:51,066
and even the texture have the paper but
some other element to the previous icon

63
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:53,016
were removed

64
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,038
like the many calendars you where the
metal rings

65
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:59,075
those elements work really necessary

66
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:03,141
to depict a daily death counter and by
removing those elements the new icon

67
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,126
is more simple it's less cluttered more
straightforward

68
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:11,051
simplicity also influence the decision

69
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,093
to go away from using lucid Agron day as
the system font

70
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:18,762
and towards using how Vatican Noida
American Lawyer

71
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,618
is a simpler typeface with Sid Agron day

72
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,610
is designed to evoke hand-written letter
forms

73
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:30,068
American oil on the other hand is
designed to clearly and simply

74
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:34,049
the pics the letterforms and numbers

75
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:37,075
without any ornamentation so the more
appropriate

76
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:40,075
typeface to use for the new design
language

77
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:43,494
what does that mean well here's a
comparison

78
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,490
you can see that the ass is a little bit
more geometric

79
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:51,057
full simpler there's less variation
between the thickness

80
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:56,129
the stroke weight between then and there
thick part so the letter

81
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,055
the shoulder here for the N has a
smoother form to it

82
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,083
less have an abrupt transition and fonts
have a more consistent with

83
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,086
to them and the next

84
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:11,425
theme is about consistency

85
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,330
again let's go back to the app icons now

86
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:19,037
from the beginning ago with 10 app icons
were rendered to look like

87
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:22,806
they were three-dimensional object to
that was sitting on a table in front

88
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,120
view

89
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:28,013
and they were rotated a bit so they
could be easily distinguished from

90
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:31,111
documents or folders plugins and
utilities

91
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:35,052
but over time there was a little bit
oven divergence going on with every

92
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:37,231
absolute doing its own thing

93
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,752
that led to some variation like icons
that have a really strong perspective

94
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:44,370
and Keystone effect

95
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:47,108
or instead of looking like they're lying
flat on a table they look to be

96
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:51,037
sitting upright

97
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:55,046
OS 10 brings a a harmonization

98
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:59,140
but the style all the icons so here the
realistic looking icons you can see they

99
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:01,076
all the same perspective

100
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:05,051
same light source same rendering

101
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:08,058
and the graphical icons these round
icons are also

102
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:11,062
internally consistent with each other

103
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:14,133
the symbols at the centre them had the
same and boss affect

104
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:21,037
the shape the convex shape the the form
is consistent across all im

105
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:25,058
let's go back to type again how America
know is the new system fun

106
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:28,063
and one of the things that the salt for
us was an inconsistency that existed

107
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:30,029
before

108
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:34,068
overtime some maps like notes had
started to use Helvetica Neue as a

109
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,093
content fun

110
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:41,172
and outs like iTunes iPhoto iMovie Final
Cut Pro and logic

111
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,280
were using help Eric annoying as a
content fine as well as a UI font

112
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:50,096
this led to serve unfortunate mismatch
between the system

113
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:55,115
and those individual aP's

114
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,045
so by changing to have Erica know it now
we have this consistency across the

115
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,410
entire

116
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,107
Mac experience and another side benefit
to that

117
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,090
there's more consistency between Mac and
I O S

118
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,013
the third major principal at FEMA this
redesign

119
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:16,432
is about death we believe that software
interfaces should feel

120
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,773
physically the two have physical
dimensionality and that should be

121
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:25,220
really plausible that dimensionality
helps you to focus on the things that

122
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:26,069
are in the foreground

123
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,132
and pay less attention to those things
which are in the background

124
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:34,351
now on I O S death is conveyed through
using translucency

125
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,940
for example the Notification Center for
the control center

126
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:41,353
and the elements that are within those
you eyes

127
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,900
also have translucency meaning similar
background colors allowed to

128
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:51,090
come through now o.o s10 pickup on S and
uses the same kinda translucent affect

129
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:57,094
for the Notification Center and other
parts the UI

130
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:01,094
now on Isleworth course we use motion a
fax to show deaths as well

131
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:04,186
so when you move the device running your
hand things have a sense a parallax

132
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:09,178
that's great for something that weighs
as late as the iPhone or iPad

133
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:13,247
but we're not about to encourage people
to pick up the iMac and start moving it

134
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:15,983
around to get the same effect

135
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:20,383
so it's still really important to use
things like gradients

136
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,248
drop shadows to convey that sense space
and correctly order things

137
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:31,423
and easy access

138
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,897
the last major principle for this
redesign is around designing your own

139
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,673
content to be content focused

140
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,180
content is what's most important not the
user interface

141
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:47,056
so for example one way to to be content
focuses to disallow there to be more

142
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:50,112
space for content so now there's this
unified toolbar

143
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:54,097
that does whether title bar

144
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:59,142
and the toolbar had done before

145
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:03,521
by unifying those elements there's now
more physical space

146
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,190
for the thing that you really care about
which is the webpage

147
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,094
itself and

148
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:13,743
deferring to content /url on content to
be the focus is also

149
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,440
about having a user interface that's
less heavy less strong so we've stripped

150
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:21,072
away love the textures and highlights in
the shadows

151
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:25,381
to have a simpler appearance that in
combination with the translucent window

152
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:26,104
chrome

153
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,791
toolbar in this case allows the content
to really come through in effect the

154
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:31,750
appearance

155
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:34,141
have the entire screen again it lowers

156
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:40,106
your content to be the center your focus

157

158
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:47,171

159
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:53,800
thank you very much take

160
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:56,042
thanks Mike good afternoon thanks for
being here as

161
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,112
they mention I'm gonna give you a little
developers tour the new UI

162
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:04,055
in I OS in Yosemite

163
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:07,112
I let's start off here by taking a look
at finder

164
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:11,044
and I'm gonna give you actually eighty
mini tour before the tour

165
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,076
the things that I'll cover we'll take a
look at

166
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:19,125
the toolbars again window control button

167
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:24,049
in New kind of segmented control

168
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:28,141
the sidebar which is translucent now

169
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,099
and then will move over to Safari to
take a look

170
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:38,144
at what might just mention the combine
to a bar in title bar

171
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:42,112
and then we'll take a look at System
Preferences to show with an example

172
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:48,019
love are animated controls search field

173
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,074
radio buttons pop-up menus

174
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:55,100
and checkboxes now after that

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,044
we will go over to Notification Center

176
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:02,095
and look at our new vibrant dark
appearance

177
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:06,104
that's used here and then the context
menu

178
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,110
which uses the vibrant light appearance

179
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:13,610
as do popovers

180
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,170
alright back to the top translucent
toolbars

181
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:21,436
for anyone who's gone and installed
yosemite already I'm sure you played

182
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,930
around this unseen as he's cool things

183
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:27,139
up you can just see them coming through
the toolbar and give you a sense

184
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,042
love your content flying under the
toolbar

185
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:35,271
how do you get it well all you have to
have

186
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,330
is an Anna school view that is adjacent
to the toolbar

187
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,051
and then it happens automatically for
you

188
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:49,060
but if you don't have that you can still
get it by using this new window style

189
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:49,064
masked

190
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:54,022
NS full-size content view window mask

191
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:57,058
simply ordered in with your existing
Windows style mask

192
00:11:57,058 --> 00:12:01,063
and you get the transparent translucent
to a bar style

193
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:06,697
this can be useful for things such as
toolbars our title buyers that show and

194
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:06,844
hide

195
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,588
over content that is not in a ScrollView
or the school he is not right at the top

196
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,800
lots more details about this in
tomorrow's advance session adopting

197
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:17,917
advanced features

198
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:23,860
the new UI OS 10 yosemite

199
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:26,149
alright tinted slater's hiding away in
the bottom right corner

200
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:30,081
this window these are little

201
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:33,135
new thing on yosemite and

202
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:38,704
to get those you just need to have a
non-directional fighter

203
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:45,020
which is a slider that has Eurotech max

204
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:49,350
alright now let's take a look at the new

205
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:54,043
window control button as well as being
flatter

206
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:57,512
you also notice that the full screen
button has moved into the green

207
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,943
button if you're sad about that

208
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,570
and you'd like zoom behavior back hold
the Option key

209
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:07,075
and you'll get them behavior I'd also
like to point out that

210
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:10,151
any window that can't go fullscreen
reverts to the old

211
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:14,750
in behavior

212
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:19,950
and then next the new kind of separated
segmented control

213
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:22,354
these are useful for things like
navigation like this

214
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:27,420
went backwards and forwards button here
or other kind incremental step

215
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:30,086
operations such as zooming

216
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:33,143
and this is easy to get by sending the
segment style n/a

217
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:37,124
segment style separated and it's nice to
know that

218
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:41,113
the style will automatically adjust
whether in a toolbar

219
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:46,032
were in a window

220
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:50,180
now I'm gonna bring another window onto
fighter here

221
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:53,049
and we'll take a look at some the subtle
differences that happen between

222
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:57,105
active and inactive Windows

223
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:03,010
when the window comes forward and
becomes active the sidebars translucent

224
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:07,101
but when it goes to the background and
inactive Sabres opaque

225
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:11,050
so it's nice to know that the
translucency is only in the active

226
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,010
window

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,001
let's take a closer look here at the
toolbar

228
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:20,040
couple things to know a good chance to
stay

229
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,233
that the metrics we tried to keep them
as much the same as possible so that

230
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,420
all year old control center
automatically move to the new look

231
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:34,049
even without recompiling should all fit
in the same state

232
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:37,268
and there's also some subtle things that
happen when you use

233
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:42,360
template images these are great way take
take advantage of our automatic

234
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:44,055
adjustment for state changes

235
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:49,084
and so I'm gonna send this window to the
back and you can see the state changes

236
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:54,550
in the template images particularly that
selected

237
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:58,274
part that segment to control look at
image

238
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,990
you see it completely change color so
you can take advantage of that

239
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:05,568
by using template images

240
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:10,300
and let's take a look again at the
translucent sidebar

241
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:15,008
once again opaque here translucent here

242
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:18,714
and how do you get translucent sidebars
guess what

243
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,040
there for free if if used in an

244
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,250
outline viewer and a stable view

245
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:28,048
and use that the highlights style to
source list

246
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:33,111
which you can do in Interface Builder or
incurred

247
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:37,067
alright and to just show how easy it was
a downloaded

248
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:41,143
a sidebar demo which was put together
for OS 10 lie in 10 points 7

249
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:47,392
an out-of-the-box it had translucent
fibers

250
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,130
now moving over to Safari to take a look

251
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:56,055
at the new kind of to a bar that has a
hidden title bar

252
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,214
hidden under Title Search Eve using this
new

253
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,570
win NS window property title visibility

254
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:06,142
and you can set the title disability and
this window title hidden

255
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:10,137
in order to get the effect that safari
hat and I'd like to point out to you

256
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:14,086
that Safari has some special things that
make this work

257
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:17,375
one of which is that they have put the
window title

258
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,250
into the combined URL and search field

259
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:24,924
and so you can still see the window
title even though there's no title bar

260
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,940
also as andrea pointed out yesterday
they've left room for

261
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:31,175
users to click in the toolbar in order
to move the window around

262
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,086
you wanna make sure you have room for
that if you're going to use this new

263
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:38,375
style

264
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,550
moving on to animated controls

265
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:46,131
search field now enemy very much like
they do on i OS

266
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:50,112
with that magnifying glass and the
placeholder text moving to the left when

267
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:54,051
you click

268
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:58,106
radio buttons have an animation and when
a nice things about them is as you

269
00:16:59,006 --> 00:17:01,465
flecked a radio button

270
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,528
the other one deflecting enemy out
simultaneously

271
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:11,380
nice little touch

272
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,119
Xboxes as well are now animated and this
is a good time for me to point out that

273
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,019
that first preference their double-click

274
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:23,024
Windows title bar to minimize if you
even

275
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:27,039
unchecked which is the default
double-clicking a window's title bar

276
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,130
will do the little hidden feature for
your and last

277
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:36,028
pop up button when you select a Papa

278
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,071
button I and

279
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:44,078
choose an item from the menu you know
and make back into place in the pop

280
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:47,171
alright

281
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:51,132
moving on to Notification Center

282
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:56,126
and the vibrant dark parents let's take
a little bit of a closer look

283
00:17:57,026 --> 00:18:01,034
as what happens when the background
changes I want you to pay particular

284
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,078
attention to those

285
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:06,099
tabs at the top say today and
notifications and see how they change

286
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,153
as the background changes it looks very
close

287
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:15,059
to standard transparency but we're
actually using special blend modes pull

288
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:15,146
the color in

289
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:22,117
a little more than just plain ol
transparency how did they get it

290
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:27,084
they use this new and a few subclass and
its visual effect for you

291
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:34,084
as well as the new vibrant dark parents
which is in an effort parents see you

292
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:34,173
can create

293
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:38,154
and an official affect you get the Anna

294
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:43,113
appearance name vibrant dark apparent
and set that

295
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:49,104
on the effect you in order to achieve
this look similarly

296
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:55,088
here's an example the vibrant might
appearance same deal

297
00:18:55,088 --> 00:19:01,167
an official affect you but this time
using the vibrant light appearance you

298
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,070
set that on your fact few

299
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:08,145
and you get this new vibrant I apparent
lots more

300
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,110
about an official affect you and
vibrancy in tomorrow's talk

301
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:17,002
and now I will hand back to Patrick

302
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,026
who will talk to you in more depth about
vibrancy

303
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:24,090
thank you very much accurate or thank
you

304
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:28,011
okay so vibrancy

305
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,095
size ritual mentioned it's not just
plain ol transversely what is this for

306
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,022
everything well

307
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:37,093
its a pretty important visual building
block for lost time as you

308
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,184
in its makes its way into many different
applications many different areas

309
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:45,109
are both in light and dark I'm most
prominently in Notification Center but

310
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:46,074
also other

311
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:49,151
other places in in the US so what is it

312
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:53,096
what is this vibrant thing well or I'm
gonna try

313
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:56,113
and bear with me here but when I try to
be constructing breakdowns

314
00:19:57,013 --> 00:20:00,090
explain conceptually what it is and was
trying to do what its goal is

315
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,082
to help give you a framework for
understanding what happens technically

316
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:04,098
with with your application

317
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:07,150
so vibrancy is advance planning

318
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:12,072
on dynamic or adaptive backgrounds so
what's advanced about it well

319
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:17,021
why I'm about in the world's world's
were to be

320
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:21,062
Cummings I I think we I'm gonna try to
make the case for

321
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:25,067
with vibrancy to pose to can not only
before but we can actually make it equal

322
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:29,105
25 in fact it's all about making

323
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:33,006
vibrancy can actually make the whole
greater than the sum of the parts things

324
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:33,081
that you put into it

325
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,128
Mexican end up with something more
interesting than the two things you put

326
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,111
into it so what two things my talking
about well

327
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:42,039
it's really all about combining
foreground and background elements most

328
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,073
%uh view our graphics

329
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:46,139
is all about combining some for gramm
content onto a back on whether it's a

330
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:47,111
button

331
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,016
onto a window background whether to Pisa
text onto

332
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,080
a button or window content background
sober combining those individual pixels

333
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:55,097
in interesting ways

334
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:59,154
well so let's do that we have this
beautiful puppy background

335
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:03,111
and let's do in traditionally let's we
have here a gray

336
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:07,048
amid tone grey circle that we put on top
at this background

337
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:10,129
and we can just put it on and now it's
okay but it kinda simply blend well

338
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:12,081
it'll come sticks out in fact

339
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:16,105
in this image now traditionally the tool
we would have at our disposal

340
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:20,030
to calm combiner ball ended in some
interesting we would be

341
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:24,051
transparency or using al for opacity so
here I faded

342
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:27,157
this gray circle by about 25 percent
maybe a little less

343
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:31,132
I'm not a design I so

344
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,037
I but you'll notice there's a problem
with this time

345
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:38,062
is it leaves a little bit I'm on the
table in terms of

346
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,154
that the resulting in stocks because
what happens with transparent is all you

347
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:43,082
doing to taking that form in the back
room just

348
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:46,083
taking a fraction fractional midpoint
between

349
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:49,108
in combining those what it really ends
up being like is like as if you're

350
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,069
taking up for going on in punching a
scream

351
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:55,101
like punch him doing the loopholes and
letting the backgrounds through

352
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,009
with the and the fact that the
background that the show through the

353
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:58,176
foreign element

354
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:02,102
into can can amor quién mardian he's in
as you make it

355
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:06,004
more to opaque it has to come get darker
and moodier

356
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:08,109
really doesn't that the back room
doesn't get the combined in an

357
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,073
interesting way

358
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:13,080
well what if we did this different what
if we and the other thing I want to

359
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:14,036
point out is that

360
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:18,013
we're not really doing anything with the
collar information

361
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:22,035
form in the background weep when we
combine in this way well what if we

362
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:25,048
to approach the problem differently what
it look but if we actually took

363
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:28,110
the color information the foreground
pixel in the background element

364
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:33,027
and combining an interesting way where
we actually trying to preserve the color

365
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:34,100
turnout in the background

366
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,079
I am just using the actual for bank or
as as a hint as to how much

367
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,218
a black color to preserving the generals
intensity level

368
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,004
so that's want that's what I'm Water
Mill Street in here in this slide

369
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,320
is actually a sort of a burn burn effect
I a burn bland

370
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:52,076
I a four-round same circle same actual

371
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:55,735
gray value here I have changed nothing
about the program elements still that

372
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,250
same

373
00:22:57,025 --> 00:23:00,046
gray circle it's just not now I've
combined with the background in a more

374
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,144
interesting where I'm using

375
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:05,130
the gray value to actually direct how
much of the color information to keep

376
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:07,025
from the background

377
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,141
I'm as walls general I'm to melody

378
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,042
I what's nice about this is you really
preserve the character the background as

379
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:15,070
you can see

380
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:19,024
and what also very nice about this is it
kind of works really well

381
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:23,106
as things change network changing the
lightness a a quite a bit

382
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:27,008
as we go between the end to the popping
in the center but

383
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:30,357
get the sort of general contrast ratio
and engine of book

384
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:34,890
that about composite is actually pretty
preserve pretty well by that planned

385
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:37,153
and in fact this design is very
resilient

386
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:41,054
to completely changing back on offer
something different

387
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:44,079
so once again I from change nothing
about the foreground element here I just

388
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,085
changed

389
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,046
now we have this lotus flower background
I'm endure

390
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:51,099
you'll see that the actual are
combinations roughly the same overall

391
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,099
character

392
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:57,114
as a result well so case that this this
is a good illustration of the basic

393
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:58,019
setup

394
00:23:58,064 --> 00:24:02,070
foreground and background blending using
sorta for more advanced bland

395
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,726
but now how do we build this up into
what we see you know its 10-year Sammy

396
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,630
today to get these are these transfers
materials well now we need to combine

397
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:13,078
with a different kinda background so
what's build up this

398
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,079
this light material here will first we
just wanna put a nice

399
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,156
my flashlight employer August that's
transparent

400
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:24,415
over the over the background to give us
a nice or like substrate onto which the

401
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,470
drawer you I because we want it or you
are directly entered

402
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:30,052
a picture of course I'm and then

403
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:34,105
all we need to do to make it better is
just blurred as a little bit and

404
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:38,007
and to keep the overall cartoon out in
the rough shape up your

405
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:41,027
a your your background but still
preserve

406
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:45,063
but but gift giver a smoother rendering
up the overall result

407
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:48,084
now you know as I went through and
brought this up I've changed nothing

408
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:48,176
about the for colonel

409
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:51,165
all I've done is a change that
background and it's that it's been

410
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:53,079
planning on to

411
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,127
and the nice thing about this is is it
still preserves that same character as

412
00:24:58,027 --> 00:25:01,073
as I'm going across in as the back room
is changing

413
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:05,128
the overall composition really preserves
its character and still live give you

414
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:06,083
some other

415
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,182
be the important color information I

416
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:14,500
up the above the back from that
underneath and and let it shine through

417
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:17,046
so in fact are I'd like to argue

418
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:20,124
the whole can be greater than the sum
parts for when you doing

419
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:24,061
when you combine using the right my mods

420
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:27,128
himself some tricky design problems I am

421
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,075
so what are these for movement fiber
materials which we speak so

422
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:34,173
ritual enumerated some the area so we we
have

423
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:39,115
built up a couple different styles are
one of which can be seen in menus and

424
00:25:40,015 --> 00:25:41,023
pop overs

425
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:44,025
then there's the general light
appearance which is what you see in the

426
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,027
sidebars and source list

427
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:50,686
I'm then there's the translucent title
bars at another fiber material

428
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:54,950
and of course the dark the dark
appearance but you saw

429
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:58,147
Notification Center there are a couple
of key

430
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:02,138
new provinces to be here is a bit what
I'm mean by this is areas where

431
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,061
your application even without taking any
steps you'll just automatically benefit

432
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:08,380
from this new compositions now

433
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,270
were using one of which of course a
source list

434
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:16,094
I then there's the transmission title
bar menus and popovers automatically get

435
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:16,173
this

436
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:20,150
as their as their background and of
course

437
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:24,914
menu bar am status items minibars

438
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:30,020
so I am how do you use vibrancy in your
app's

439
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:33,391
how to use it effectively well once
again

440
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,435
I it's all about combining for ground
with background

441
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:40,669
in an appropriate way improper an
interesting way well

442
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:45,090
and a special effect few is the view
that actually is performed the role of

443
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:46,009
this background the

444
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,081
thing that we've built up in the slide
before with that white gambler and

445
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:54,110
translucency this provides a subsidy
onto the canvas into which we're control

446
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:58,073
and it as and it's offered in light and
dark

447
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:02,097
basic material flavors stuff for you
bedtime ritual

448
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:05,114
bridge we demonstrated Birmingham

449
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:09,098
and the important thing about in
official affect you and what it does to

450
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,177
your applications that takes care

451
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:15,122
are all love the stuff all of the steps
needed to make sure that

452
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:19,731
as the content either underneath her
window or underneath view

453
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,780
inside the window as it changes as you
scroll things around as

454
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:27,197
you drag Windows run as your background
changes it can automatically update

455
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,951
as the company's changes you don't have
to worry about any that all that is

456
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:34,490
handled for you

457
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,061
so much movement and its appearance so

458
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:40,122
in this appearance is in this equation
is the one that's taking the role of the

459
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:41,119
foreground element

460
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:46,105
is gonna its gonna drive both the
selection for content as well as

461
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:50,052
drive some other blaming behavior so I

462
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:55,083
it's offered im to to appearance burns
and his passion environment light

463
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:59,108
animus appearance name vibrant dark

464
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:04,011
and what its role in life is is to
provide

465
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:07,027
a sort of a panoply of colors controls

466
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:10,108
and template image treatments that are
appropriate and suitable

467
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:14,106
provide for anyone to pull within Visual
Effects use and carbon surfaces

468
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:19,010
now this is important because as we have
as you saw in the

469
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:22,820
I'm in the earlier section %uh vibrancy
selecting the former No

470
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,730
now these the way things combined for
different in traditionally so selecting

471
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:29,262
something appropriate for 500 is very
critical

472
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,130
and so we need alternate sets up these
design values

473
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:36,079
alternate versions this for government
to get the right result

474
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,158
on these firemen services so

475
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:43,082
as I said its it's really the in this
appearance can really be fought over the

476
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:46,121
thing at that helps elect unidentified
your for content source makes it

477
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:48,107
appropriate in locked in for that

478
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,029
for for firing for the material

479
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:56,158
and once it's in effect then apk it can
automatically

480
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:59,790
pick up the appropriate colours pick up
the appropriate template remains

481
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,122
pick them all up and do with the and
pick up the right blend months

482
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:02,981
especially

483
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:09,240
I for appropriate for the for the view
and them to your rendering onto

484
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:13,112
okay so how do you do this well it's
with such a try to do a downer

485
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:19,038
exciting

486
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,054
one

487
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:25,147
okay so I am so what we're gonna do here

488
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:30,256
is I we have a very very very very
simple application

489
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,700
I that's basically just a an image
editor

490
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:36,039
I'm image editor with some adjustment
sliders here and what I'm gonna try to

491
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:39,020
show you is how simple it is to just

492
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:43,004
and some vibrancy into your UI

493
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:46,094
how little will ever take so all we all
we're gonna do is we're gonna but we're

494
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:49,073
going to try to do is win tried to give
visual effect few

495
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,993
and put it inside that little inspector
in rehearse the controls inside a bit

496
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,740
to give it a vibrant vibrant parents

497
00:29:57,074 --> 00:30:00,081
so let me go ahead and do that so

498
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:03,113
the first thing I'm gonna do years I'm
going to

499
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:08,096
create a visual effect few an
initializer with the inspectors frame

500
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:13,102
and then I'm going to said its
appearance to be the vibrant dark pants

501
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:17,133
now next and then the only other thing I
really need to do is I need to re host

502
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:18,105
the

503
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:23,059
I am take out the existing content the
controls under the existing content view

504
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:26,104
and put them into I'm this new affects
you

505
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:30,006
and then place it has the content view
the window

506
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:33,075
so that's all I'm doing here this is a
really directly relevant to the demo but

507
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,156
I just for here for

508
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:38,059
for on steam for disclosure here

509
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:42,109
so I key thing to see here's the

510
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:47,318
parents being put on here and you see

511
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:52,520
presto Chango I have not only some nice
dark fiber material but I also have

512
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:56,069
I you know alternate slider Ultima
controls after automatically selected

513
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:59,085
different artwork that's appropriate for
rival rendering specifically for the

514
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:00,152
dark material

515
00:31:01,052 --> 00:31:05,099
the text colors have inverted and
everything is is updating dynamically

516
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,104
now all it took was deploying that
visual affect you

517
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:17,049
okay so back to the home

518
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:23,383
okay and out that was a very very
cursory demonstration for a lot more

519
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:24,280
details

520
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:27,035
about all the ins and outs official
affect you

521
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:30,184
and some other a summer the more
advanced techniques abusing them to

522
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:31,127
build

523
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:35,039
somebody somebody bill you I someone to
some other things that we have in our

524
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,048
system

525
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:40,032
please go to the to the in-depth talk
our tomorrow adopting advanced features

526
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,073
the new why

527
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:44,088
you know is tenuous amity

528
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:47,187
okay so let's move on

529
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:51,156
to fonts colors an artwork these are the
elements that are

530
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:55,138
typically things that you you you you as
an app developer my to make some

531
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:01,087
specific design choices and provide
material for

532
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:04,570
so was talk of Arts first

533
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:07,076
so what's new and fun but swell

534
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:10,154
about the system fun that's not that big
it always

535
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,137
it's not a big change at all I actually
it is so

536
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:18,816
this is a here's an illustration of the
the Mavericks many borrowers Slusser

537
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:21,140
grounding

538
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:24,037
and here's what it looks like today with
homework anaya

539
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:27,059
I it's actually a pretty significant
difference

540
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,148
it can be seen even more dramatically if
you compare the two side by side

541
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:35,127
are you notice it's a it's quite the
sizing kirker six old different but in

542
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:37,051
general it is

543
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:42,120
a lot crisper typographical Ian cervical
a cleaner layout

544
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:48,019
so let's talk about this new system fun

545
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:51,126
so it's all american I am but is not

546
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:55,075
just plain old your mothers however can
I it is especially

547
00:32:55,075 --> 00:33:00,078
optimized version have an economy that
has been optimized for lost time

548
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:04,050
and what do I mean by optimized well
anytime you put

549
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:08,043
a font for corrupting system I wanted a
pic to key two things to balance

550
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:12,094
are I aesthetics and layout
compatibility

551
00:33:12,094 --> 00:33:15,105
now for first editor all we were
concerned with we would just be

552
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:19,062
render the font exactly how the type
designer originally envisioned it

553
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:22,331
try to do our best job in rendering
remembering the individual letter forms

554
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:26,980
and leave it at that what the problem is
a for sure switching system fight this

555
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:29,146
means we're updating the typography in
applications that haven't been modified

556
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,108
in an even be aware of it

557
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:35,062
so we have to think about things were
like the layout may change because

558
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:38,351
optimal response have different size
characteristics

559
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:42,790
so the version Republican know that
we've deployed has been specifically to

560
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,130
to balance a stray off to try to strike
a good balance there to make sure that

561
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,027
we still get the aesthetic

562
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:51,055
when they were really looking forward to
scream typography but not at the cost of

563
00:33:51,055 --> 00:33:54,070
happy occasion compatibility

564
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:57,015
let me go into that with a little more
detail explaining

565
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,967
so here's here's the an emulation ever
find a ride home

566
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:05,320
ap bio menu item on the that you might
see on the menu bar

567
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:08,321
and this is happy to introduce the
ground

568
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:12,560
and you can see here sorta
approximations are the

569
00:34:12,056 --> 00:34:15,062
the intercooler spacing here and now as
a switch this

570
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:19,095
to american know your there's some
interesting things going on here

571
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:22,112
because you must be over offering
shorter

572
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:26,021
but actually if you if you look
carefully

573
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:29,640
some other letters actually got bigger
summon them got shorter so it's not a

574
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:32,102
straightforward thing saying oh yeah how
america's everything's risking a truck

575
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:33,054
by Sir

576
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:36,163
finish not that much more subtle than
that can become too dependent some

577
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,000
things are getting wider

578
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,041
some things are getting shorter
something's getting more consistent

579
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,810
where they were inconsistent with the
ground between the king

580
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,278
capital letter sizes and in the lower
case letter sizes

581
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,211
so it's it's a complicated equation so
that's why it was important

582
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,648
to 22 optimizes metrics appropriately

583
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,200
so that they they've the so that they
solve this compatibility problem

584
00:34:58,002 --> 00:35:00,085
you somewhere here you can see them to
on top of each other in consumer

585
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:02,062
dramatically

586
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:05,480
this difference is you bf in particular
is actually shorter

587
00:35:05,048 --> 00:35:08,073
mister grimes wider I'm sorry its

588
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:11,092
finner in the serb-run in wider im

589
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:14,175
in Hoboken I but almost all the other
letter forms except maybe the d

590
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:18,104
are actually I considerably shorter

591
00:35:19,004 --> 00:35:25,533
so solely are compatible that's a that's
a big big topic is an important topic

592
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:29,130
and what do we do about it

593
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:33,047
well for for for unmodified applications

594
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,101
one technique that we've applied use

595
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:41,068
to apply to wear compression if there's
a danger of the text ring

596
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:44,687
clipping given existing bouncer for
example if you have a text field

597
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:48,700
size just so to just fit just perfectly
I'm

598
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:51,016
on I'm maverick's you know there's a
chance that some that that same

599
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:55,050
same text field I've if no measures were
taking would

600
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:59,803
would would be would get clipped are
with the new fart

601
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,490
because some strange choice in there was
causing the the overall layout to be

602
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:04,051
longer

603
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:07,076
one those circumstances we're just gonna
imply a bit over interred with

604
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:08,128
compression

605
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:12,092
to try to make sure that it fits so you
with see all the information and there's

606
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:15,491
no information loss

607
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,490
and as I'm and this is active for for
abs built against Temple in an earlier

608
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:22,120
only so this is an important takeaway
here because

609
00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:26,013
if this this compression medication that
we do

610
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:29,044
does not apply if your app is targeted
and built against the

611
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:32,058
1010 STK I'm

612
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:35,106
so this so what does this mean this
means that you can you don't have to

613
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:38,055
worry about your existing applications

614
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:41,930
having problems with your users but when
you going forward we encourage you to

615
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,131
really look carefully

616
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:47,540
at your at your text in your application
to make sure that you're using on ole

617
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:48,690
alter that your

618
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:51,122
really you sort of comparing testing
sure that that the with serve all your

619
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:55,094
text elements is is optimized according

620
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:59,138
and also want to mention that this I be
this compression technique that we apply

621
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:03,207
is not a silver bullet by any means I

622
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:08,080
in one shouldn't think of it as the
secure all and the reason is because

623
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:11,009
wear compression is not come without a
significant cost which is

624
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:14,069
that it can really effect legibility I

625
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:18,123
and that's especially true I'm 1x I'm on
retina displays where there's very few

626
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:20,031
pixels to work with

627
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,770
for every for every cliff in every
pixels doing a heckuva lot of work and

628
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:24,540
if you're compressing things together

629
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:29,123
really making suffering terms the
information much ability

630
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:32,970
so how do you use this new system font
you make sure your app

631
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:35,171
use using the appropriate type

632
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:39,145
well thankfully we have a whole bunch of

633
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:44,046
system fun selectors to choose from and
that's what we encourage you to use to

634
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:45,108
make sure that you're using the right

635
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:49,537
the right thing so if you're if you're
doing this in in first builder

636
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:53,430
rest assure that you know if you as long
as you stick with the standard font

637
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:53,932
elections in the

638
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,319
far pop-ups shopping for school you
should be okay

639
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,260
otherwise we encourage you to use the
system fonts workers are the ones that

640
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:00,120
aren't as font

641
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:04,086
an example there's many more but I'm
just picking a few to highlight here

642
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:09,323
I response system fantasize and it's fun
polled system fantasize

643
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,530
and a new one actually label fantasize
actually that's not

644
00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:16,087
I don't think that's necessarily new I'm
is another label from coming out so

645
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:19,175
opener so all of the youth selectors

646
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:23,154
won't make sure that the appropriate UI
font on its optimized

647
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:28,106
has been selecting is going to be used
at the proper for you

648
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,027
important takeaway here if you remember
nothing else

649
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:35,866
about the fun sections talk is please do
not explicitly set your font

650
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:39,170
U-turn code or an IB hope Erica know
your

651
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:43,041
you know as a literal string cuz that
that's the actual document content fart

652
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:46,076
that's been not optimized version you'll
get very unexpected results

653
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:50,091
and it make your application less
compatible going forward as we continue

654
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:50,100
to improve

655
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:56,106
upon the typography a first time

656
00:38:57,006 --> 00:39:02,015
okay so colors so colors are in often
underappreciated element

657
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:06,950
I'm a few why I which is a shame because
if you actually look at most windows on

658
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,154
most applications about 90 percent the
pixels

659
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:12,147
if that you know it are actually
composed of color feel so they're

660
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:16,051
actually pretty important part of
building your you why

661
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:19,095
and it's especially important on this
day of a

662
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:23,004
multiple appearances and different I'm
in different sections of your

663
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:26,030
applications

664
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:29,006
so we have system colors them a

665
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:34,048
I'm I'm Inc in cocoa and these are what
we urge you to gravitate towards

666
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:38,100
an by system cause I mean two things I
mean literally the concourse provided by

667
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,085
the system

668
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,128
in terms of their color selectors an ass
coloriage but I'm also

669
00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:47,050
would like to emphasize that shouldn't
have colors as a system of colors not

670
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:49,022
just as a set of numbers that you might
pick up

671
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:53,069
you know from a designer like I'll RGB
128 142

672
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:56,678
136 no victim is a system as in like

673
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:00,990
what is the semantic color that would be
appropriate to use here

674
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,140
this is where system called can really
help

675
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:07,049
because many have the standard colors
like for example in his color control

676
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:07,172
text color

677
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,090
in a scholar I I'm secondary select to
control color and

678
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:16,066
you as a whole host of others have been
adapted have been optimized

679
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:21,068
are to make sure that they work in all
areas and under all appearances

680
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:24,141
in your eye and they may also change in
the future so it's just a good way to

681
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:25,129
bulletproof your

682
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:31,038
yourself I'm for textual elements

683
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:34,950
a in your you why we also I'm

684
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:38,734
would like to encourage you thinking of
lineout sure you I'm serving information

685
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:40,080
heart

686
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:43,024
hierarchy and by that I mean

687
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:47,108
view my have some sort of primary sort
of information elements are labels many

688
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:51,767
my some secondary supporting information
you'll see this pattern and in many in

689
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,480
many different applications

690
00:40:53,048 --> 00:40:56,123
in Yosemite and we've introduced some
new

691
00:40:57,023 --> 00:41:00,041
color selector specifically to help with
this

692
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:05,068
the two coach likes our label color and
secondary label color

693
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:07,687
and the nice thing about these is
they've been specifically designed to

694
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,305
work well in almost any context that you
might put them on with the menus which

695
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,650
have the like five min appearance
regular Windows

696
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:17,069
Notification Center in its stark

697
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:20,218
I you why no matter what you do

698
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:24,490
it'll look correct

699
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:28,101
so what about control text a button text
or other things like that

700
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:33,022
well the good news there is the control
text

701
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:36,117
koko's gonna make sure that control text
automatically adapts

702
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:40,031
to any particular control stay

703
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:44,042
that your your control me find itself
and so actually

704
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:48,065
I I would encourage you to if you must
you have a really compelling overriding

705
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:49,754
reason to do so

706
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:55,620
please let pic kit provide the coloring
for any textual elements on your buttons

707
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:58,145
and and an image look at images in the
second because there really are such a

708
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:00,164
wide range of

709
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:05,930
interaction in control States and our
designers over carefully selected colors

710
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:08,102
and styling for each one of these across
all the different appearances

711
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:12,104
and doing so well this will let the the
kid

712
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:16,073
provide optimal parents including
adapting

713
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:19,152
to the vibrance appearances he richard
nixon example of what

714
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:23,085
label color and secondary label color
look like across

715
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:26,099
the light and the dark 51 appearances

716
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,137
you can see the pics or preserve their
design intent there being priming

717
00:42:30,037 --> 00:42:30,099
secondary

718
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:33,131
they're both vibrant the site but
secondary one is a little bit more so

719
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:34,790
that is

720
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:38,040
its leading a little more the background
through it a little more transistors

721
00:42:38,004 --> 00:42:40,008
pick up a little more color the
background

722
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:43,073
I'm but it'll preserve it'll be afraid
design choices I

723
00:42:43,073 --> 00:42:46,128
on any of these appearances including
the been on Bourbon appearance

724
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:51,837
regular our column

725
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:55,450
okay so last time here

726
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:59,062
in the section artwork so our workers is

727
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:02,078
only other important elements that you
might want to integrate

728
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:05,140
into your application and for this word

729
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:09,005
on the thing I wanna mainly highlight is

730
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:12,074
you template images

731
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:16,760
I template images can be an excellent
way to get maximum flexibility

732
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:19,147
out of your artwork and have it be
resilient across

733
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:23,121
wide range of you I scenarios in your
application

734
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:27,072
sorter template images a brief review
temple images are

735
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:30,191
image resources were the image content
itself

736
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,916
is per just providing the shape up
off-the-cuff the control of the element

737
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:36,650
that you want to depict

738
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:39,734
it's providing new color information
it's something you can put color in

739
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,890
there but it's going to get ignored
because it's basically just the shape

740
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:44,094
that it better than is critical

741
00:43:44,094 --> 00:43:48,166
and then what happens is makes it
possible for after to transform it

742
00:43:49,066 --> 00:43:52,515
with a context-specific apparently can
take that shape in a can render and

743
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:55,780
translucent gray one it's disabled or
commander

744
00:43:55,078 --> 00:43:59,126
bright blue one selected and you can me
to make always interested in style it

745
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:03,099
in a way that's appropriate for specific
apparent am for specific interaction

746
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:08,191
state

747
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:14,115
okay app compatibility

748
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:18,184
so macros 10 yosemite

749
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,373
does bring some big changes to your
app's look and feel

750
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:25,700
and even perhaps that really haven't
made any changes %uh the visual

751
00:44:25,007 --> 00:44:26,043
differences can be quite

752
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:31,305
quite significant this is dictionary
hearing even those is a pretty

753
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,376
straightforward application

754
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:37,040
you can see the I the differences are
are notable

755
00:44:37,004 --> 00:44:42,263
both in terms of the generous tax as
well as the layout I some the elements

756
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:46,940
well so what does this mean for your for
your app

757
00:44:46,094 --> 00:44:49,127
and how to think about having a wrap or

758
00:44:50,027 --> 00:44:53,096
on Yosemite well

759
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:56,360
first and foremost we really like to
encourage you to

760
00:44:56,549 --> 00:45:00,310
make your app is awesome as it can be on
your salmon in take advantage of as many

761
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,096
of these

762
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:04,149
new you why experiences that we've
provided the building blocks for

763
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:08,418
I including the including definitely me
too

764
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:14,970
visual effects %um vibrancy but what
about deploying a maverick's

765
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,191
you know it's quite legitimate to meet
him to want to have an application that

766
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:17,169
works both

767
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:22,164
on maverick's in and in on your family
are so that you can have

768
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:26,127
per support all other customers

769
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:31,101
well having it both ways can be quite
challenging

770
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:35,790
given the changes that we've made into
designer

771
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,880
a fourth time as a case study

772
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:43,750
I I'd like to show Xcode here now this
is my Xcode running on

773
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:48,099
I maverick's and noticed the up the tab
which was carefully designed to blend in

774
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:50,928
very well with the title bar mixer well
here we go

775
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:56,000
in yosemite and are changed the time or
material and suddenly everything doesn't

776
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,043
match

777
00:45:57,043 --> 00:46:01,047
well this is Nick illustration of the
challenges that napkin face if they have

778
00:46:01,047 --> 00:46:02,066
to support both

779
00:46:02,066 --> 00:46:05,165
the old old you I language as well as
the new

780
00:46:06,065 --> 00:46:10,074
well we all know this had a happy ending
because this is in fact what the excuse

781
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:11,923
that you're living with right now

782
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:17,290
I looks like on you so many because
Xcode actually did make an optimization

783
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:18,828
to make sure they look perfect for

784
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:24,330
I'm your semi release

785
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:27,045
so what techniques can you use to

786
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:30,050
set yourself up for success

787
00:46:30,005 --> 00:46:33,304
I in the face have these big design
changes

788
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:37,330
well first and foremost we encourage you
to stick with the system what we mean by

789
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:37,117
that is

790
00:46:38,017 --> 00:46:41,206
where possible I miss you have an
overriding and

791
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,330
reason to do so I stick with standard
control stick with

792
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:48,046
template images stick with the system
colors

793
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:53,068
I stick with system fonts all those
things will be automatically managed and

794
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:56,135
after appropriately by after across both
platforms

795
00:46:57,035 --> 00:47:00,063
and will look reasonable like for
example the entire title bar all the

796
00:47:00,063 --> 00:47:00,117
control

797
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:04,064
all the all the fun selectors all the
colors to automatically resolve

798
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:05,113
themselves to the proper thing

799
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:10,038
on each platform after there there are
many cases where that may not be

800
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:10,126
sufficient

801
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:14,067
and we actually do have to write
different code like for example

802
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:17,073
the selected PAP change in Xcode

803
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:21,042
well you can also to use one-time checks
to

804
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:26,074
to tailor your code in resources for
each design

805
00:47:26,074 --> 00:47:29,943
so let's go through two techniques there
are more but these are two primary ones

806
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:31,420
I wanna to

807
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:34,140
to show you for what you might be able
to do well the first thing could be a

808
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:35,081
simple check

809
00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:39,166
so let's say you have an application
it's actually go deployment target of

810
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:39,930
$10.9

811
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:42,138
and you wanna you wanna potential
introduce some pirate you are but you

812
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:45,437
know you can't just directly reference
that stuff

813
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,806
I'm you know I'm tonight because it
doesn't exist well

814
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:52,410
what you can do is you can do using that
with the

815
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:56,046
stanwyck when can be whoever are Susie
redeployment targets at the $10.9 you

816
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:57,094
can always check to see if

817
00:47:57,094 --> 00:48:00,102
are an important symbol like in this
case and its appearance name vibrant

818
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:01,056
dark

819
00:48:01,056 --> 00:48:04,068
is my MIL in only fits my mail then you
can go ahead in

820
00:48:04,068 --> 00:48:08,087
and use that code and set up a visual
effects you for example

821
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:12,091
for a piece if your UI that can be very
remembers nice thing about this code is

822
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:13,576
that

823
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:18,410
it automatically brings in the vibrancy
when an application is running

824
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:21,470
on yosemite but does whatever

825
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,190
me to do before I'll I'm maverick's

826
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:28,398
another approach is to do a version
check

827
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:31,790
to serve check but Runtime Environment
my I'm I'm

828
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,091
as a little more straight forward Lamar
old school so one

829
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:37,230
this is the standard technique that we
recommend for doing that at least for

830
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:41,630
Coco applications trying to Kolkata

831
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:44,066
work I compare the in a second version
number

832
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:48,232
against the pre published Constance make
sure you get that to greater than sign

833
00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:52,690
correct don't put it the other way you
end up with a rather surprising results

834
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:55,094
I am and then this would allow you to
for example select different image

835
00:48:55,094 --> 00:48:57,453
resources are going to totally different

836
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:01,750
code our constructions I'm across one

837
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:06,874
version of the OS versus the other

838
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:11,970
up bill so

839
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:15,986
in general what we'd really like to
encourage you to do

840
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:21,100
is look for opportunities to freshen
your design

841
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:26,040
in as many places as possible and
freshen your design everywhere

842
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:29,123
we really think that a majority of your
customers are going to majority for

843
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:31,050
users i should say

844
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:34,104
are going to be on the US amity design
and your family

845
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:38,095
in the in in the very near future and
it's going to be

846
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:41,139
if you do have to make a choice

847
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:45,041
a about opinion is on your word about
about

848
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:49,050
about I'm changing things on I'm older
platforms

849
00:49:49,005 --> 00:49:53,009
I I would also like to encourage you to
when in doubt favor the new visual style

850
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:54,043
what I mean by that an actual

851
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:59,041
Xcode is an example of this as a case
study

852
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:02,125
it's okay to go and bring some of the
elements that have been introduced

853
00:50:03,025 --> 00:50:06,077
him and so I'm L matter to be
interesting to yosemite and bring them

854
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:07,156
back into your maverick's

855
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:11,092
app UI design language so for example

856
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:13,176
and I don't mean like obviously the
whole translucency think that that

857
00:50:14,076 --> 00:50:15,088
doesn't work on all

858
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:19,100
on maverick's but I for in terms of
partnerships button cliffs

859
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,018
are your icon for example it is totally
OK and it actually works are reasonably

860
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:25,092
well

861
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:29,098
to take somebody simpler cleaner I
design styles that are

862
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:32,195
featured in Yosemite and to have them
show up on your buttons are in your

863
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:36,158
you win the title bar a in your
application maverick's

864
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:42,141
so I can help relieve some pressure

865
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,950
so I A we're getting close to wrapping
up here

866
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:50,350
so just want to recap what we talked
about today

867
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:53,060
so we have this there's a brand new user
first time first time

868
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:56,725
we walk through that we've talked a
little bit and trying to understand the

869
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:02,190
components a vibrancy in what role the
players and what it does for you

870
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:05,115
and we talked about adapting your
applications to these new

871
00:51:06,015 --> 00:51:11,090
these new features please a primitive
another plugin for the advanced session

872
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:15,064
for more in depth exploration above
using a special affect you

873
00:51:16,045 --> 00:51:19,090
using fiber materials and of some other
from the

874
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:23,057
tips and tricks of getting I getting
these you eyes together

875
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:28,093
with alacrity

876
00:51:28,093 --> 00:51:32,462
so in summary a lot of excitement lots
of exciting design changes

877
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:37,400
coming to West Ham and I if there's one
message i'd like to leave with you

878
00:51:37,004 --> 00:51:40,055
has stepped to the coca firms can help
guide you through all this change

879
00:51:40,091 --> 00:51:44,520
and please avail yourselves their
services

880
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:48,190
for more information we have our
excellent developer evangelist right

881
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:51,338
over here with the fantasy makers to
experience

882
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:54,630
and handkerchief you know him if you
have any questions

883
00:51:54,063 --> 00:51:58,100
and there are many related sessions I
including the what's new in Cocoa which

884
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,013
happened earlier today

885
00:52:00,013 --> 00:52:03,089
are actually yeah earlier today today's
Tuesday

886
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:06,112
I the there's also the fans talk
tomorrow

887
00:52:07,012 --> 00:52:11,251
I also wanna point out the creating
extensions for I listen or stem

888
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,397
which happen actually is concluding
happened just an hour ago

889
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:17,744
and the reason I mention as I think the
talk about Notification Center

890
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,266
extensions which is one of the places
where you use

891
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:25,230
dark fiber an appearance and there are
also some

892
00:52:25,023 --> 00:52:28,632
some there's an Xcode sessions and
Interface Builder sessions and encourage

893
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:29,790
you to go to we're

894
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,123
I'm they're not gonna touch directly on
some other stuff is very important to

895
00:52:33,023 --> 00:52:33,612
see some

896
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:36,894
some the new new features that have been
exposed in new wine in your preschooler

897
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:42,750
and if you haven't gotten enough my not
an engineer colleague Mike Stern he's

898
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,164
having a

899
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,858
talk right following this one called is
an intuitive user experiences

900
00:52:48,029 --> 00:52:52,650
and you can get more neva more design
wisdom

901
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:53,158
and with that like to wrap up and thank
you
