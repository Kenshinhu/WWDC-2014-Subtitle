1
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:15,134
alright good morning everyone welcome to
this morning session

2
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:19,042
name is Mark Miller I'm in iTunes
engineering manager

3
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:23,043
on the store and we're going to talking
about a foot tools for app developers

4
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:26,122
now

5
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:31,057
just in case anybody is a new to the
program or unfamiliar with what it's for

6
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:34,083
we're gonna go over a quick overview
love how it works

7
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,117
what its purpose is and how you can use
it a

8
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:41,030
it's also been a couple years since
we've last a presented here

9
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:44,028
so we'll talk about what's new in the
program in a what

10
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:48,089
to but new things you can do with it and
finally there's going to be a deep dive

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,122
on tools and services that you can use
to

12
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:59,022
interact with the program so first off
we kinda need a castle characters

13
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,827
who's involved with the affiliate
program and how they interact with each

14
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:04,460
other

15
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:07,102
as you might guess their the customer
yours

16
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:11,011
and the iTunes stores and they are

17
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:16,022
talking to you and talking to the iTunes
Store but one might not be so obvious

18
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:19,111
is behind-the-scenes there's an
affiliate network

19
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,220
and the affiliate network mediates the
interaction

20
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:28,350
between you and the store an affiliate
network is where you go

21
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:31,042
to sign up set up payments manage

22
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:34,113
and track your campaign I performance

23
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:38,562
and go to check on any support issues
you have

24
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:42,970
so what's it for

25
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:46,196
a the key thing they're trying to do
with nuclear program

26
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,220
is to drive customers

27
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:54,024
to your apps and other content so

28
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:57,099
you might have a game and perhaps you've
released a sequel to it

29
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,101
you want to promote that app and you can
do that using the affiliate program

30
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:06,258
similarly you might already have a
website use to promote your app's

31
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:10,690
and you can affiliate those links and
start getting the benefits before a

32
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:10,144
program that way

33
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:14,108
but it doesn't have to be euro naps

34
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:19,050
that you're promoting you can promote
other after Belper zaps

35
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,714
and other content and this is pretty
much all the content on a music store

36
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,221
excuse me on the store on so that's

37
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,329
music movies TV shows books

38
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:34,340
podcast anything you can think I've is
supported by the by the program

39
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,230
and the use case here is

40
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:41,050
I am that there's pretty much

41
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:44,804
if there's a wide use case for what you
can do with it on

42
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,310
you might have a

43
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,442
soundtrack its related to your game and
you can promote that

44
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,120
or if your productivity app and there's
a similar app that

45
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:59,271
a works well with it you can

46
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:04,900
promote that from within the app on your
website most the ball

47
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,014
you're trying to connect your users with
content but they're going to want to

48
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:08,070
download

49
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:12,043
a their you're interrupting their
workflow a little bit

50
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:15,572
to send them to the store summit
recounts make sure that link

51
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,037
is are relevant to what they're
interested in and something that they're

52
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:20,890
going to want to buy

53
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:23,156
now

54
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:27,315
to keep the program is that

55
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:31,831
all your links need a little bit have
data on them

56
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:35,961
to to function correctly to you ever
been affiliated to an existing iTunes

57
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,231
Store link

58
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,898
and that's it you're ready to go with
the affiliate program

59
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,260
in return for

60
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:46,735
marketing and promoting that the iTunes
App Store's you earn a commission on

61
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:47,046
sales are

62
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,780
are generated from that referral for you

63
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:55,897
you get the benefit love tracking the
effectiveness of their marketing

64
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,608
with our tools and

65
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:03,505
a small this works on both web and in
your app

66
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,180
so there's no reason to limit the

67
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:10,867
usage up your affiliate program to the
web you can also do it from within your

68
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:11,078
app

69
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,538
now

70
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,850
under the covers those links are going
to be

71
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,181
clicked on our top done in iowa's and
the data from the URL is going to be

72
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,094
copied into a cookie

73
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:31,186
cookie lives for 24 hours on the user's
device

74
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:35,113
in a supporting but you realize that the
data is tracked in a cookie

75
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:40,052
and not somewhere on the server this
means that if the user

76
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,181
click on one of your links and then
moves to

77
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:46,310
her iPhone or iPad to continue I

78
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,200
browsing the store that any

79
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,880
purchase made on the device will not
credit to you

80
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:55,119
so it's same device that the tap

81
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:59,071
happens on and the purchase

82
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:02,074
now once the purchase mishap happens the

83
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:05,343
data is copied into the database and the
database

84
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,840
I is sinks to the affiliate network

85
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:12,169
and that's how you get paid

86
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,102
now the terms are really great you
aren't 7 kam

87
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:21,011
percent commission on all sales that
means that if you link

88
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,940
to for example an app and the user want
to buy another app

89
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,092
you get credited if the user actually
leaves the App Store

90
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,660
and goes to buy something on the music
store you also get credited

91
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,485
at seven percent for all sales within 24
hours

92
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,623
now this is kinda important it in it's a
case of last one wins

93
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,120
a you are operating in an ecosystem love
love love

94
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:52,121
other developers and its whoever is the
most recent

95
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,330
referral gets the credit for the sale

96
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:58,077
so if some if a user taps on your link
and then

97
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:01,226
three hours later tops on another link
from another

98
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,965
affiliate that affiliate gets credited
for the next

99
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:09,404
24 hours worth of sales

100
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,930
now best the ball this is a seamless
experience from the point of view of

101
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,232
your users

102
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:19,151
a an affiliate link looks and acts just
like a regular iTunes Store link

103
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,280
so here we've got an example have cut
the rope and they're promoting

104
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,657
the sequel to their up cut the rope to
so when the user taps on get it now

105
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:32,440
an affiliate link everything axe just as
you expect

106
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:35,137
the store carousels in and bacon

107
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:39,084
preview by look at reviews look at
screenshots

108
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:43,090
brother store and again after that click
this

109
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,043
it's not just aP's that are credited to
that affiliate

110
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:53,052
its music movies TV shows all that

111
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:56,053
so that's the affiliate program in a
nutshell

112
00:06:56,062 --> 00:07:00,171
let's talk about what's happened in the
past couple years

113
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,990
most importantly we've had a massive

114
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,168
territory expansion this was the state
of the world or at least the

115
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:11,083
affiliate world in 2012 we were on three
continents

116
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,140
and we had program support in 45
countries

117
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:21,070
since then we have introduced

118
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:25,102
ok the affiliate program to a 147
countries

119
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:30,301
at the 3x expansion and fifty those
countries happen in the lot in 2014

120
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,240
alone

121
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:38,133
now that's pretty great your

122
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,374
promoting your app's and other content

123
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
worldwide with with your program

124
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:48,053
but best of all

125
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:51,712
you only need one network to work in the
entire world

126
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:55,370
if you're familiar with the program from
a couple years ago you had to sign up

127
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:56,065
with one program

128
00:07:56,065 --> 00:08:00,078
to work in them the Americas a second
program to work in Europe

129
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,647
the third program to work in Australia
New Zealand

130
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,427
nowadays one network gets the worldwide
access to a 147 countries

131
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:16,120
this is really huge

132
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:19,033
now it means one sign up one

133
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:23,055
payment setup all your tax information
all that sort of financial transactions

134
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:24,574
stuff that you need to

135
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,072
just get started with the program you do
that once

136
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,060
and your working across the globe

137
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:35,795
even better we have a common link
structure

138
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,912
for the entire world now

139
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,523
this is what a normal unaffiliated
iTunes Store link looks like

140
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,640
you can see that in the US storefront
it's an app called

141
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:51,073
iMovie and there's the iTunes Store
content ID at the end

142
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,096
used to be that if you wanted to add
affiliated as

143
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:58,098
this URL you would end up with something
like these two options

144
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:01,170
and you have to do it in a region
specific manner so

145
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:05,022
the euro on top was for the Americas the
Euro on the bottom

146
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:08,158
was for europe these girls are messy

147
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:12,058
they're confusing there even suspicious

148
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:15,071
if a user were too

149
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,117
look at the link that you're calling
iTunes link and examine it a little more

150
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:19,099
closely

151
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:23,115
they were today 01 this is I'm not sure
when clicking on any more they might be

152
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:28,053
turned away by that so no more that

153
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:31,129
nowadays we take an existing

154
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,032
Store link and we are just a small bit
of data

155
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,054
and the host is still the same
itunes.apple.com

156
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:42,147
so what we're adding here to the base I
URL

157
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:46,086
is small bit of affiliated a

158
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,086
the first part of that is the eighty
query parameter

159
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:53,091
the stands for affiliate token and the
value is essentially you're

160
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:57,172
user ID within the affiliate program
this is how we identified you

161
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:01,099
and this is how you get credited for
purchases made

162
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:06,143
after user taps on your link so it's a
very important to get this one right

163
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:11,080
also in the affiliated as the CT query
parameter and CT sense for campaign

164
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,014
token

165
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:15,155
and this is an optional qua primary so
you don't have to put it on

166
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:19,077
but you can do a lot of really important
things with it

167
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,173
if you have a campaign that you want to
track separately from the rest of your

168
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,077
marketing efforts

169
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:27,081
you can use this campaign and it will
show up differently

170
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:30,120
in our you eyes so for example

171
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:34,089
you might have a campaign for your
website you might have a campaign

172
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:38,090
a separate campaign for the interior
pages on your website

173
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,065
you could have campaigns for each email
blasts the sand out

174
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:45,052
if you're doing online advertising
you're buying keywords

175
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:48,138
you can have a campaign for each of
those you can have campaigns for links

176
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:50,087
within your aP's

177
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:55,153
a you can do a lot love analysis to find
out what works and what doesn't

178
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:59,056
with your marketing efforts

179
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:02,138
now it's important to note one thing
about these URL's

180
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,062
I said that there's one link structure
worldwide

181
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:09,128
bites content is not necessarily
available

182
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:14,035
around the world the the situation for
abs is pretty easy

183
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:17,064
most cops are available in every country
but if you're linking to

184
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:22,087
music or movies or books the the rights
may not carry over from one store front

185
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:22,162
to another

186
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,135
so you need to if you're trying to send
your user to a particular piece of

187
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,041
content

188
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,043
I it's best to check if it's available
in their storefront

189
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:36,086
before you present them with that link

190
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:39,105
another common mistake that you make one
first interacting with program

191
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:43,036
is getting your query strings wrong the
URL's

192
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,037
are on fairly simple but it

193
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:49,100
there's a few gotchas that you need to
be avoid

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,038
the first thing to make sure I've is to
identify if there's already querystring

195
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:57,105
on the URL now the query string started
the querystring

196
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:01,099
is identified by the question mark and
if there's no question mark

197
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:04,170
and you blindly append your affiliate
data using ampersand

198
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:08,046
that URL probably won't even load for
use with their just going to have an

199
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:09,080
error

200
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:13,031
so don't do that what you want to do is
checked for the question mark

201
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:17,064
and if it's not present on the string
add the question mark

202
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:20,110
and then your affiliate data now

203
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:24,059
the reverse is also a gotcha and this is
just as important

204
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,125
if there's already a question mark in
the URL

205
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:30,118
that means that there's an existing
query string you need to use the

206
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,095
ampersand as a delimiter

207
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:35,130
instead of using another question mark
if you click on if

208
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:39,054
a user clicks on you're our two question
marks in it it's not gonna parsed

209
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:39,147
correctly

210
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:43,065
and you're not going to be credited with
the

211
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:46,118
referral so the key thing is

212
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:50,090
look for the question mark and it's
already there is ever sent to attach

213
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:57,009
your facilitator

214
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:00,090
now I mentioned

215
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:04,094
one network where the key benefits of
having one network worldwide

216
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,134
is that you can have a global unified
view

217
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:12,043
I love how your marketing is going now
this

218
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:16,040
is a dash for that shows you in real
time

219
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,072
who's cooking and what what links
they're clicking on

220
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,032
she's not who's cooking but the type of
like that they're clicking on

221
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:26,126
the first thing you notice about this UI

222
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:30,044
is that you can track clicks overtime

223
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:34,083
and you can zoom in from a year's worth
of data

224
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,085
all the way down to a day and again
these these

225
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:41,088
a Grasser updating in near real time so
in this case

226
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:45,159
we're looking at per month over month
view and our current month is plotted in

227
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:46,125
orange

228
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:51,100
against the previous month's performance
so you can see if your graph is trending

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,076
down

230
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:55,076
or if it's a different

231
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:58,123
compared month-over-month an adjuster
marketing campaign

232
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:02,025
accordingly also have no

233
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:05,030
is that the conversion rate is mentioned
here

234
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:08,010
and you should pay a close pay close
attention

235
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:11,136
to this value if the conversion rate
starts diving

236
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:16,037
that might represent a problem with your
marketing efforts

237
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:19,078
I maybe your URL's are not

238
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,080
are really in exciting users into buying
or maybe there's a problem with your

239
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:23,074
links

240
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:27,082
and something needs investigating so
keep an eye on that one

241
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:31,099
also on the global dashboard

242
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:34,103
you can zoom in and get a per country
view of things

243
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:38,007
the if if you're

244
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,066
a operating in more than one country you
can see how well

245
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:46,079
you doing in the US as opposed to the UK
or in South America her

246
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,086
or wherever also if

247
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:53,171
you are promoting more than one type of
content so for example

248
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:57,108
absent books or movies and music you can

249
00:14:58,008 --> 00:15:01,096
slice and dice and get reports on how
each one of those is performing

250
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:04,099
so there's a lot of rich data here

251
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:07,105
and furthermore there's more utility

252
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,061
up at the top you can see additional
tools

253
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:16,096
for interacting with the program you can
get more in-depth reports of what's

254
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:16,158
going on

255
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:20,102
can measure payments and other settings
a

256
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:24,056
sup make sure it's check out all the
options at this provides because it's a

257
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,088
great way to actually see

258
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:31,172
how you're doing with your marketing
efforts so that's a global dashboard

259
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:35,161
its a single unified view love

260
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,067
a single network thats operating in 147
countries

261
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:43,047
I can't tell you how excited I am about
the fact that we have one network that

262
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:44,093
lets you operate worldwide

263
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:48,096
it's a huge a simplification what we
used to have to do

264
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:52,158
so very exciting hopefully this point

265
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:56,065
you are similarly exciting you wanna you
ready to go

266
00:15:56,065 --> 00:16:00,073
go sign up for the program and you want
to know how how next to

267
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:03,110
what the next steps are in terms of a
integrating

268
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:09,012
for that we've got our tools and
services section

269
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:13,028
we'll start talking about simple tools
to get you started quickly

270
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:16,125
a these are things that you don't need a
computer science degree

271
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:20,079
to work with its maybe just a matter I
love

272
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,098
creating a couple drinks and adding them
to an email or to your website

273
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:26,162
are somewhere in your app these tools a
really great for the

274
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:32,078
the one offs the manual so to set up
there's also more advanced tools

275
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,092
so if you want to find I what's going on

276
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:38,186
I really in the now on the store

277
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:43,167
and promote that sort of content these
tools let you do that we also provide

278
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,089
smart out banners

279
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,156
smart app in iOS allow you to I'm
promote your app from your website

280
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,074
in a very seamless way a

281
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:56,161
there's a lot of power there and in the
right situation can be very very useful

282
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:02,116
the stork it product sheet and iTunes
radio I have been recently added to the

283
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:03,078
program

284
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:07,124
we'll talk about it how to work with
those how to get the most outta that

285
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:11,223
and finally will finish with the
collection

286
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,463
feature with that allows you to fully
define dynamic playlists

287
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,980
for the store this can be really useful

288
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:23,697
for customizing content for users

289
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,580
first start with the simple stuff the
simplest the all

290
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,080
is link maker this is I

291
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,042
a simple search box where you can come
in

292
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:38,067
and type a search term get results

293
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:41,131
and get links especially if you click

294
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:45,032
into link maker from within the
affiliate network

295
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:48,129
your the URL that you come in with is
going to have all your affiliate did a

296
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,040
pre-populated

297
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:54,011
so you need to worry about adding the
affiliate data to the URL itself

298
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:58,086
on you need to worry about question
marks an ampersand and your own coatings

299
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:01,099
all dramatically easier

300
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:05,053
so this case we're going to search for
ed Sheeran he's

301
00:18:05,053 --> 00:18:08,085
a UK singer-songwriter with a lot of
awesome

302
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:11,123
great songs and we can see that his
albums

303
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:16,084
I are available in the research results

304
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:19,119
and by tapping on one of the search
results we get

305
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:25,021
a nice pop up I love HTML that we can
drop right into

306
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,073
a web page not only that this

307
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,166
HTML has a number of different options
for the formatting so this is the

308
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,081
small-format for the badge if you'd
prefer

309
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,148
a large batch we've got its not to do
that

310
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:42,062
similarly if you just want to have a raw
Texas lack

311
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:45,069
maybe this is for and its channel email
blasts or something like that

312
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:51,033
you've got the the raw text available as
well

313
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:54,070
so that's like maker in a nutshell it's
simple its

314
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,012
all you I oriented its a bitter bitch
two kno you can drop in

315
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:01,026
om it's a great way if you haven't
started the year only one interested in

316
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:02,140
linking to a few pieces of content

317
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:06,011
to find that but maybe

318
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:11,006
maybe you've already got a website up
and running and you've got

319
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:15,101
a couple hundred links to various pieces
iTunes content

320
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,009
in that case you might be interested in
auto link maker

321
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:22,950
auto Inc maker is away to

322
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,580
on the fly attach affiliated to existing
iTunes links

323
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,126
within a web page its mobile java
scripts that you paste into your page

324
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:35,030
and on load it actually finds all

325
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:39,085
the links to the iTunes Store and when
they're clicked

326
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,679
the event handler attach is affiliated

327
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,570
to the URL and you get credit for all
the links for your re-signing

328
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:49,062
to the page so if you don't want to go
in and edits

329
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:54,356
hundreds or thousands of pages in your
content website

330
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,730
to you know annotate all these things
with the lady at a our link maker can

331
00:19:57,073 --> 00:20:02,074
really help you out there

332
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,158
so that's the simple I study you can do

333
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:10,151
you might be more interested in the
advanced stuff for finding content

334
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,098
for thats what are the best tools are
the search

335
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:18,111
and look at API's and this provides
meta-data

336
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:22,099
access on the web up to up-to-date

337
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:25,121
and very very

338
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:30,087
easy to do some

339
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:33,091
their two main actions the first is
search

340
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:36,173
this is probably like you expect you can
find content by name

341
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:40,101
if you know the artist name for the song
name or your user wants type something

342
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:43,025
in and find specific pieces content

343
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:46,091
you can do that with the Search API the
lookup API

344
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:49,096
allows you to cross-reference your

345
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:54,075
ID's with the iTunes Store so you might
have a self-concept measure interested

346
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:54,079
in

347
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:58,101
and you know the iTunes Store content
ID's you can get the latest data about

348
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,003
that content

349
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:03,095
using lookup ICLEI and all these
responses are in

350
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,113
the Jason format thats JavaScript object
notation

351
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:10,059
its pretty much the lingua franca for

352
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,081
data transfer on the web

353
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:16,134
so sick a look at the Search API a

354
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:20,083
the only thing that's required to get
started with the Search API is the term

355
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:24,150
way from your in the course is the
search term that you're interested in

356
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:28,019
but there's a lot of modifiers available
and you can do some really interesting

357
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:28,833
stuff

358
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:32,486
to find specific pieces of content hmmm

359
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,820
you can also change the nature of the
content that comes back the language

360
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:37,111
query parameter

361
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:41,019
allows you to specify the

362
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:44,100
localization above the response so let's
say you're searching

363
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,019
in Canada for a piece of content but you
know you want to localize it to French

364
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,072
you can pass in language Eagles fr and
get a result back in French

365
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:57,109
media is a constraint for the search
itself

366
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:01,017
if you only want are interested in
movies are only interested in books

367
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:04,134
you can specify media equals movies are
media equals books

368
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:09,623
a content back that way but what if your
actually just interested not just

369
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,560
in say music but you're interested in
songs

370
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:17,059
are you interested specifically in
albums you can use the

371
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,082
entity query parameter to specify a very
specific

372
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:24,148
Pisa content are collection of content

373
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:29,056
that way attribute

374
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,085
is another query primary that focuses
the search term

375
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:35,102
on a specific case so the

376
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:39,028
the search will only be applied to
specific portion love

377
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:42,053
the content and this would allow you to
do for example

378
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:46,087
if you're query is for Madonna you might
be looking for the

379
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:49,129
the musician Madonna and you could use
attribute equals

380
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,054
artist name and that searches would only
be for artists

381
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:56,137
whose name contains Madonna on the other
hand if you're looking for the Beatles

382
00:22:57,037 --> 00:22:57,128
popular song

383
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:02,046
lady Madonna you can specify at a
beautiful song term

384
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:07,051
and get song results back

385
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:10,086
to limit query parameters another one
where I

386
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:13,375
it can come in handy in many situations
by default

387
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:18,330
you're going to get 50 results back I

388
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:21,033
for a given query but if you only want
five

389
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,038
there's no reason to spend time parsing
the resulting waiting for the response

390
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:28,127
for larger datasets you can either
decrease or increase the size of the

391
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:31,058
response that you get

392
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:34,097
and finally there's call back call back
is I

393
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:38,164
very useful for web developers if you
are trying to do

394
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:43,111
something that operates within the Java
excusing that browser security model

395
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:47,074
if you're running JavaScript in a
browser you may not have access to

396
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:51,109
to make a call tonight instead Apple dot
com but you can use the car back where

397
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:52,085
parameter

398
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:55,109
to essentially call a function

399
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:59,072
with the result I love the query

400
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:02,106
I'm this can be very useful and just
about every

401
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:08,055
JavaScript libraries like jQuery what
have you supports call back

402
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:11,078
and all these responses once when you do
a query

403
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:14,707
all the results are in a digital format

404
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,590
and their dictionaries of content sorted
by relevancy

405
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:22,898
and relevancy is an important concept
it's not

406
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:27,530
it's our best guess at what you actually
searching for

407
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:30,144
so it depends on how appropriate is the
content to the search term

408
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:34,132
it also depends on other factors like
popularity so that can be

409
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:39,121
so you your get your search crews are
not necessarily static are not going to

410
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:40,510
be sent I'm

411
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:43,114
if another pizza content becomes more
popular it might move from

412
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:47,303
ranked number three direct number one in
your search results change you know the

413
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:52,870
creep renders the same

414
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:55,092
now the lookup API uses a lot of similar
a

415
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:59,049
group renders to the search API but the
only thing requires a

416
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,082
is an ID and the idea can be

417
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:05,094
and iTunes Store content ID or can be a
list

418
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:08,094
comma-separated those same ID's

419
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:11,156
to look at a few also support other
identify rare

420
00:25:12,056 --> 00:25:15,149
standards so if you have you PCs for
albums

421
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:19,064
or ISBN is for books or ISRC

422
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:22,843
or any on number I've other on

423
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:30,419
standard ID schemes you can pass those
in as well

424
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:36,039
so we support similar modifiers to the
Search API language

425
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:39,096
is a as you would expect call back is as
you expect the

426
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:42,131
results are the exact same content
dictionaries and you can

427
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:47,080
passing into some function you define a
javascript

428
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,137
entity is slightly different and a look
at API

429
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:55,000
so you're passing in one or more content
ID's

430
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and you can use the entity ID to
actually navigates

431
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,053
up or down the content re I will go into

432
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:04,055
how you can use it in a bit

433
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:07,058
and again the results are Jason
dictionaries so

434
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:12,170
this exact same content whether using
Search API or look up API

435
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:17,009
and the responses you get back are very
very rich in data

436
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:20,156
now I know this is a wall of text but
there's a lot of information here that

437
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,150
you can use

438
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:25,043
to populate your out your your you eyes
or

439
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:28,164
to populate your recommendations

440
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:32,120
there's expected you get the artist's ID
the artist name

441
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:36,033
the album name the song name apt name
what have you

442
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:39,113
I but there's also you can get the mall
its most recent version on the store

443
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:42,049
what are the release notes for that
version

444
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,087
on when was it released what how much is
it what

445
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:48,096
what's the file size maybe only want to
recommend small files to use

446
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:52,106
on some sort of constrained device

447
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:56,855
you can see screenshots I album artwork

448
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,190
what is the user rating: for this
particular content

449
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,070
what is the age rating: for the content
all this can really

450
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:07,012
be useful if you're trying to populate a
UI

451
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:12,070
so that said let's go through a couple
examples I am

452
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:16,096
but say we are developing a music app
and we want to show

453
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:21,177
the user a search API so that they can
find content on the store

454
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:25,133
so we might have a search box that they
can type something in

455
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:30,046
and we would put that content into the
sort if you are I'll

456
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:33,048
no one highlight that were specifying

457
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:38,074
the US storefront and we're passing in
the term that we're trying to search for

458
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:42,109
in the query parameter term in this case
the user is typed in

459
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,020
the ATM see

460
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:50,053
now this query

461
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:53,097
alone is going to be

462
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:56,153
I what you're going to get is basically

463
00:27:57,053 --> 00:28:00,126
1 I've Ed Sheeran's popular songs from
past couple years

464
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:04,053
which is called the eighteen and that's
going to be very popular

465
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:07,432
so that's gonna be at the top of the
list following that you're gonna see

466
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:10,060
something like the 80's movie

467
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:13,072
which came out couple years ago and

468
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:16,073
is seconds behind the the song content

469
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:19,114
and following that you gonna get about
45

470
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:23,081
results for the a-team TV show from the
80's

471
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:26,105
now the a-team show was awesome who
doesn't like the a team that's great

472
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,038
up but we're music app so we might not
be interested

473
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:33,113
in getting TV show results

474
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:37,019
now the simple thing to do in this case
would just be attach

475
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,508
a limit we can say oh well I'm only
interested in the music South music

476
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,330
stuff is

477
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:45,099
breaking highly to all put limit Eagles
won and I only get one result back

478
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,131
that's great but what if another sequel
to The

479
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:52,059
a team's movie comes out and to me
that's highest

480
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,138
our music app is suddenly for a

481
00:28:55,669 --> 00:29:00,280
showing content for movies that would be
good

482
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:03,059
so that's one option

483
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,106
the couple other things we could do we
could say well we're only interested in

484
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:07,105
searching

485
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:12,060
for the song term the a-team or were
only interested in songs

486
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:15,074
bet a a real related to the search term

487
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:19,105
the a team but that's not really that's
going to limit us a little bit

488
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:23,084
because what if we want to show albums
or what if we wanna search

489
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:26,136
on albums that are called

490
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:30,855
the ATM there's probably several does so

491
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,570
for our use case this is probably not
such a great idea

492
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:38,058
instead we need to find the right thing

493
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:41,074
to specify the type of content will were
interested in

494
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:44,075
and here its media equals music where
music app

495
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:47,102
we want people to be able to search for
artists

496
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:51,881
albums or songs whatever so we can
specify a mediator

497
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:56,750
music and we get just results were
looking for so we run this query

498
00:29:56,075 --> 00:30:03,075
and we get the results we want back
which is great

499
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:08,198
now this is just one piece a result

500
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:13,497
are one result back I let's say are you
I we

501
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,471
whitten we might have an album focus
rather than on a specific song

502
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:22,090
and let's say that are you I we want to
know

503
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:25,108
how how much does the content cost in
the use or front

504
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:29,045
and furthermore we want to show them all
the songs

505
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:33,624
on that album in that store front now

506
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:38,038
I like to say that if you have a problem
if no one else can help

507
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,173
and if your problem related to content
meta-data on the iTunes Store

508
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,755
maybe you can hire to look up a TI

509
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:51,970
in this case we have figured out that
our user is in great britain

510
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:54,161
and so we were just changed the country

511
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,070
code in the URL to BGP Great Britain

512
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,450
and we're passing in the ID

513
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:06,083
up the collection itself now look at a
TI has a very simple model

514
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:09,095
for content on the store there are
tracks which are

515
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:12,314
individual indivisible pieces of content

516
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:17,220
so this would be songs books movies TV
episodes

517
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:20,321
aP's there are collections

518
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,582
which are albums TV seasons that sort of
thing

519
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:27,188
and their artists these are musicians

520
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,635
actors app developers that sort of thing
three levels

521
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:35,220
and you can use the lookup API to
navigate that hierarchy

522
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:38,431
so we're passing in the

523
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:43,690
collection ID for the album ID to look
at the PI and we're gonna get

524
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,096
results back to see if it's available
for sale

525
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:49,685
in Great Britain but we're not going to
see

526
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:53,610
is what tracks are available on that

527
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:56,110
URL what we need to do in that case

528
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:59,970
is attached the entity that were looking
for

529
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:04,036
and the entity people song will tell
that look at API

530
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:08,934
okay give me back the result that I ask
for but also give me back the songs

531
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,690
that are on that album and here

532
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:16,073
we get the of the results back to you
expect so we get the

533
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:20,278
album name which is plus and the first
track on that album

534
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:23,402
is the a team and so on the rest the the

535
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:27,950
songs on night do our on that album you
can also go

536
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:30,096
navigate up the content hierarchy so if
you've got a song you wanna know the

537
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:31,110
artist you can pass in

538
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:35,037
at City Eagles artist in track that that
way

539
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:38,645
so there's a lot you can do with a look
at API

540
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,146
its on it's all up to date you might

541
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:46,450
want to know about price changes for
particular things the to look up a TI

542
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:47,004
allows you to do that

543
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:50,740
now that said

544
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:53,157
you might have slightly bigger needs

545
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:57,266
in terms of data and for that

546
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:01,840
we have the enterprise partnerships or
UPS as we commonly call them

547
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:04,107
these are balk

548
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:08,546
meta-data and it covers virtually all

549
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:11,676
iTunes Store content and this is very
much I love

550
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,280
for intended for big data needs

551
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:18,960
and one is a big data its it's a lot I

552
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,805
it's something like if you download the
full data set for this week

553
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,691
it's going to be 10 gigabytes of textual
data compressed

554
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:29,906
it's not for the faint of heart but I
can be very useful if you're trying to

555
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:34,710
established I N and understanding of the
entire iTunes universe

556
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:37,760
within the feeds are

557
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,210
multiple files and the files represent
database tables

558
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,022
in a relational database sense so
there's for example

559
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:49,441
an artist table representing artists
your musicians at all personal like

560
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:53,070
there's an application table for a

561
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:57,076
iPhone apps and Mac App stuff sort of
thing and as you might expect if you're

562
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:57,830
familiar with

563
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:01,172
relational databases there's a
relational artist application table

564
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,952
that represents which artists produced
which

565
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:09,030
aP's so you can in just this data into

566
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:13,003
a relational database or other data
store for analysis and

567
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:16,882
on run your cruise that way and again it

568
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,926
aimed at organizations that have really

569
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,000
deep data needs bit there's a lot of
data there's pricing for

570
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,589
all countries that the iTunes Store
supports

571
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:31,623
oMG and and analyzing that in dealing
with the data

572
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,780
especially on an ongoing basis can be
really a huge

573
00:34:35,078 --> 00:34:39,081
after fortunately we do have an importer
script

574
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:42,180
a the script is available as

575
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,930
Python up a and its intended

576
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,270
to in just a feed

577
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:52,081
into a bicycle database but its the
sample code is

578
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:55,870
is open so if you'd like you can provide
a different back and

579
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,970
and maybe right to Hadoop HDFS

580
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,173
or something like that if your needs go
that way

581
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:08,392
the first part it's it's it's a great
way to get the whole

582
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:13,127
content database frightens on you can do
a lot with it but it did it takes some

583
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:16,855
doing

584
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:21,130
a slightly simpler is the rss feeds

585
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:25,732
are these are dynamic feeds for kinda
what's hot in the store

586
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:29,250
and by that I mean you got a couple
options if you can see

587
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:32,100
what's most popular for each piece of
content and in each genre

588
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,819
what's but selling really well right now
what's new what's recently added

589
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:42,060
on whether this is you know the hot new
single from

590
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,013
today's artists or may be abusive an
album

591
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:49,138
that has been out at the store for for
decades and is just arriving now

592
00:35:50,038 --> 00:35:53,090
that shows up in the new in Risley at it
fits

593
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:56,010
you can see featured content what's
actually showing up on the store right

594
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,819
now

595
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:01,000
on what what did you see when they open
iTunes

596
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,579
to the main page in and check that out

597
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,670
funny you can see customer reviews for a
particular piece of content what are

598
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,073
people saying about it

599
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:13,043
there's I'll if you want to track your
own aP's performance you can see

600
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:16,127
recent customer reviews using that RSS
feed

601
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:20,075
our sis is available in I Adam format

602
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:23,123
thats pretty much the standard for RSS
these days

603
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:26,872
it's also available in Jason if you
don't wanna parts a bunch XML you can

604
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,670
get

605
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:32,152
Jason for not return to you and in just
that way

606
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:36,106
so that the advanced stuff on

607
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:40,078
there's all this and more is very well
documented on the website

608
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:43,079
and we'll have a URL for you at the end
of the session

609
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,128
on smart at banners

610
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,720
are away for you too

611
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:55,156
cross-reference your ap from website
you've probably seen this browsing the

612
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:57,100
web with mobile Safari

613
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,049
you into a website and this little
better slides down

614
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:04,648
and allows you to download the app if
you haven't already

615
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,110
or OpenID if you've got it installed I

616
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:11,650
or dismiss it if you actually not
interested in the app so from the user's

617
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:11,156
perspective

618
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:15,071
is really powerful its if you want to
it's bare

619
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:20,145
and if you don't it gets out of the way

620
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:24,073
what it does allow you the developer to
do

621
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:27,144
is to show your content from your
website

622
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:32,473
in a native customer experience to your
app can provide the mobile Safari maybe

623
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:34,560
can't

624
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:37,121
so this is really powerful I if you want
to

625
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:43,027
show are have people look at the content
on your website

626
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,056
in your custom app

627
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:49,075
and again if if users not interested a
simple tap

628
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,920
and it goes away and they're not
bothered by it so how to integrate with

629
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:52,163
that

630
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,802
it's actually fairly simple I you drop a
simple matter tag

631
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:00,540
into the head of your web page and the
meta tag

632
00:38:00,054 --> 00:38:03,603
has your Apple ID to find in it that's
pretty obvious we got it

633
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:07,133
know how to find it and when Safat
Mobile Safari sees that

634
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:10,730
its gonna fetch the content get latest
price

635
00:38:10,073 --> 00:38:13,073
and show it to the user

636
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:17,124
you can also pass in your affiliate data
so here we've got her through a token

637
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:21,026
which defines us for the affiliate
program and we're

638
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:24,045
were saying the campaign so can as smart
banners that we can see

639
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:29,143
how many people are actually clicking on
the smart banner from our website

640
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:34,064
now the app argument is actually a
really important piece today to hear

641
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:38,068
if we're running a news website or music
recommendation website

642
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:41,145
and we're asking the user to leave
Mobile Safari leave all that context

643
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:45,414
and launch into this custom app

644
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:49,000
we don't want to lose we don't want them
to

645
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,052
you have started the homepage oversight
again the app argument

646
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:55,124
is actually provided to the app on the
command line and

647
00:38:56,024 --> 00:39:00,045
you can see you can see the same content
that the user was looking at

648
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:03,091
on the store so it's it away you know

649
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,520
its easy easy integration without really
interrupting the flow

650
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:10,740
things so that smart app better

651
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:13,077
if you've got a large website it's a
it's a very useful tool

652
00:39:13,077 --> 00:39:16,386
for for

653
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,700
cross referencing your website and wrap

654
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:26,025
the circuit product sheet is a brand new
feature that we've got

655
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:30,567
I am and for the affiliate program its
existence iTunes 6

656
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,380
and allows you

657
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,090
to show iTunes Store content without
actually leaving your

658
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:42,107
the workflow that your user was an so
for example we've got here on Twitter

659
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:49,817
the user sees a link to the iTunes Store
and taps on the icon

660
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:55,710
and the store she shows slides up and
allows the user to do all the

661
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:58,149
expected things that you would do in the
in the store so you can read reviews you

662
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:00,398
can look at screenshots

663
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,560
on you can by it right then and there

664
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:08,154
most importantly when they're done they
can dismiss the store

665
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:12,117
or the store she and the right back back

666
00:40:13,017 --> 00:40:16,106
and the ap on the page that they were

667
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,970
they were in before so there's no double
tap to the home screen going back to

668
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:19,152
your apt

669
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:23,098
it's all rights in the same flow

670
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:26,103
now the store she as I said has existed
in nineteen sex

671
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:30,937
but only recently have we added it to
the commission structure

672
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,500
so that means a few if you add a

673
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:38,029
affiliate data to the store she you're
gonna get paid that same seven percent

674
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:39,423
over 24 hours

675
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:45,113
that you did before

676
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:48,650
to go over demo how we can use the
circuit proxy in our ups

677
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:52,081
I'm inviting a friend Rick Rubin staying
up to shows how to use Xcode in

678
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:55,138
drop it in thank you much fine
recruitment thing

679
00:40:56,038 --> 00:41:00,097
II right tools and automation for the
iTunes Store and App Store and other

680
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:04,426
related products and mark at me to put
together a quick app to show how the

681
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,381
circuit product that works

682
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,185
out in the lobby before the session

683
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:14,950
getting read a little while before that
for me switch over to

684
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:17,156
I was here

685
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:21,113
on summer fire up the app today right
now

686
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:27,018
and then I'll explain how it was built
afterwards

687
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:31,063
so here we have your typical stick
figure doing a juggling trick ap I'm

688
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:35,072
sure you all have several these loaded
on your own I was devices

689
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:40,125
and from the user and I'm mesmerized by
this juggler I made a fate myself now

690
00:41:41,025 --> 00:41:44,088
I would like some sort of a juggling
related game

691
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:47,100
all look there's a button right here in
this very ap

692
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,004
the will let me get that content from

693
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:56,093
in this case the App Store so fight up
on that link

694
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:59,174
it'll bring up the stock hit product she
just as much shown

695
00:42:00,074 --> 00:42:03,193
and in this case the

696
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:07,040
the circuit Prachi is displaying a

697
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:11,072
juggling themed pinball ap now the key
thing here is that while it

698
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:14,088
may look is that if I am in the App
Store right now

699
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:18,077
on the juggling to adapt is still
running their

700
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,670
in the background so

701
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:25,071
if I had wanted to when I brought that
up I could have actually

702
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:28,077
decided to buy this app I'm not going to
do that right now get them cheap

703
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:33,049
but for an actual custom I might do that

704
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:37,098
and then you the affiliate would receive
credit for that purchase

705
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:40,127
on you bring us up one more time now if

706
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:45,500
I had decided to click on to tap on the
store link in the upper right

707
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:49,029
then the user would be taken to the App
Store

708
00:42:49,074 --> 00:42:52,125
that seemed content would be displayed
II

709
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:57,044
and anything at that that user but
within the 24 hour bounty window

710
00:42:57,044 --> 00:43:01,433
you the affiliate would receive a
commission on all those purchases

711
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:07,854
a summer switch over now and I

712
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,124
show you what actually happened there so
here we have the new affiliate

713
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:13,810
dashboards and Mark should before

714
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:16,087
and this is this is live in Safari

715
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:21,099
I and you can see that there there are
the Eclipse that I made during the demo

716
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:25,118
the partition up tap that I made on this
bumpy early was when I was rehearsing

717
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:31,114
before half on answer this shows the in
near real time tracking

718
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:35,050
I love I love the affiliate

719
00:43:35,005 --> 00:43:38,864
I'm I'm not but this way and bring up
exclude

720
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,451
and

721
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:46,270
show you exactly how you can go about
putting the stock it product sheet in

722
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:47,056
your own aP's

723
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:50,420
it's very simple I'm

724
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:55,201
so the first thing you need to make sure
you do is

725
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:58,750
link against the Starkid

726
00:43:58,075 --> 00:44:01,168
framework other to the public from Mark
that is available to any I less

727
00:44:02,068 --> 00:44:02,152
developer

728
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:06,121
and it lets you interact with the iTunes
Store the App Store

729
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:12,190
in various ways in this case the ways by
the circuit product she

730
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:16,398
Syria the header for our main view
controller

731
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:20,571
I'm and again just shown here that

732
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:24,250
we are importing the structured
framework but left this

733
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:28,090
access the circuit prodigy sorry this is
all objective-c I haven't had a chance

734
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:31,075
to read and swift justice

735
00:44:32,056 --> 00:44:35,088
I so here we have the implementation

736
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:39,154
for the view controller and this is the
key method right here this is a method

737
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:43,090
that I have defined on the view
controller class

738
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:47,071
I project called simply show star sheet
for products

739
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:52,331
on takes three promoters the iTunes ID

740
00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:55,822
I the affiliates ok in and the campaign
took

741
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:59,170
now this is the new difference in I O S
8

742
00:44:59,017 --> 00:45:04,166
I as mark mentioned the started product
sheet itself has been available since I

743
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,392
was six but previously you could not
include

744
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:11,078
the affiliate data only one primary was
accepted which was the iTunes ID

745
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:14,680
faster now you can add the affiliate ok
and that's your usual fully a token that

746
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:15,093
identifies you

747
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:18,942
and the campaign token which has might
mention can be any string up to 40

748
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:21,060
characters in length

749
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:24,025
that you can use to identify your
different campaigns grip your data

750
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:29,092
how everyone to analyze I'm

751
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:32,097
so I take these three parameters and I
put them

752
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:37,241
into a standard in its dictionary

753
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:41,460
but since it has been on

754
00:45:41,046 --> 00:45:45,165
simple dictionary these are symbolic
constants that are defined in the star

755
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:47,040
kid from work

756
00:45:47,004 --> 00:45:52,493
on the S case store product promoter
iTunes I demand in a fire

757
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:55,720
is the iTunes ID that's the song the
past 10

758
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:58,211
and the two new ones the product primary
affiliate talkin

759
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:02,720
and the product from her campaign took
I'm those are optional you don't need to

760
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:02,691
include them

761
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:06,364
but since you are an affiliate you
probably do want to conclude them

762
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,640
that your commissions I

763
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:12,433
so the next thing you need to do is
actually

764
00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:16,700
create to the view controller you do
that using a

765
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:20,051
standard objective-c outlook and that
model which public from there with

766
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:24,070
I need to send a delegate for it which
will be called back when

767
00:46:24,007 --> 00:46:27,656
sides tend to dismiss the sheep on in
this case were simply setting the

768
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:29,890
delegates to ourselves

769
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:32,818
the same Durkan you control or object
that we're using

770
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:37,410
on so here's the key call right here

771
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:41,113
we need to load the product into the
controller

772
00:46:42,013 --> 00:46:45,014
so this is the method a on the

773
00:46:45,023 --> 00:46:49,090
struck it view product control on look
product with primers

774
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:52,040
primers as the dictionary we just
created that contained again the iTunes

775
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,094
ID the Philly talking and campaign took

776
00:46:55,094 --> 00:46:58,149
on it also takes a completion block

777
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,097
which is the standard objective-c block

778
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:05,150
on which were returned a result

779
00:47:06,005 --> 00:47:09,086
simply yes or no as to whether it
successfully loaded

780
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:12,960
and in the case that it didn't
successfully load for some reasons they

781
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,241
that you

782
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:17,630
somehow had to an incorrect piece of
content didn't actually exist

783
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:21,065
on the store I A there's an error primer

784
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:24,372
on and in the black we define what we do
in these two cases

785
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,440
in this case if there's an air weird
slogging it normally in an actual app

786
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:31,121
you would probably want to display some
sort of dialogue or you I to the user

787
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:36,098
saying that this content for whatever
reason failed to load in the sheet

788
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:39,169
and if it successfully loaded here we're
simply logging that it loaded

789
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:44,468
normally wouldn't really need to do
anything in that case gone

790
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:48,420
so this point you have loaded the
product into the sheet but you haven't

791
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:52,171
actually displayed sat at this Cali is
here

792
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:56,410
on some the call on ourself

793
00:47:56,041 --> 00:48:00,043
which is our view controller present be
she controller

794
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,075
on animated namely 1 yes

795
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:06,077
and that also takes a completion block

796
00:48:06,095 --> 00:48:08,167
and in this case again we aren't doing
anything in particular in the completion

797
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:09,148
block

798
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:13,056
just for reference for logging that
we've completed

799
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,092
on one more important

800
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:21,123
a method here on is product view
controller did finish this is the car

801
00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:23,132
back method

802
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:26,343
on that gets called whenever the

803
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:30,440
sheet action is complete either by the
user can cancel clicking outside of the

804
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:30,453
sheet

805
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:34,960
or going elsewhere from the sheet I and

806
00:48:34,096 --> 00:48:37,133
this is where you actually dismissed the
sheet to get it to go the way otherwise

807
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:39,046
it will remain up

808
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:42,070
the can selection appear to have done
anything

809
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:46,033
on I and this is simply the

810
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:50,195
Bibi action Interface Builder action
that we tied

811
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:55,139
to the button that was in the top the
app and simply in this case preloaded

812
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:56,077
with

813
00:48:56,077 --> 00:49:00,066
the iTunes ID love that juggling pinball
ap

814
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:04,330
that I showed and the affiliate talking
and the campaign took

815
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:07,232
the code for getting the guy to do the
juggling trick is left as an exercise

816
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:10,830
for the viewer

817
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:13,592
so that's the circuit product sheet on
very simple to implement its just a

818
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,341
couple calls and that's pretty powerful
in conjunction with the affiliate

819
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:24,359
program

820
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:28,140
thank you mark alright thanks very much
like those awesome

821
00:49:28,014 --> 00:49:31,040
fly cassettes were to proceed I you can
do a lot with it

822
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:35,037
and possible for users its very on
intrusive

823
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:39,166
so take a look

824
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:43,185
next up on our listings talk about is
iTunes radio

825
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:48,020
night in Trader launched recently and
even more recently

826
00:49:48,002 --> 00:49:52,341
we have added it to the affiliate
program

827
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:55,458
which means that if you link to an
iTunes radio

828
00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:59,394
station you get credited for

829
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:02,920
that referral and again it's

830
00:50:02,092 --> 00:50:06,171
very easy to do I shoes another example
using our friend Ed Sheeran

831
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:10,145
and wherein the sound hound ap and
they've got a link

832
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:14,124
down near the bottom love that links to

833
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:18,130
iTunes radio when the user taps on that

834
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:21,094
the radio station is going to be created
been added to their stations

835
00:50:21,094 --> 00:50:24,188
and the song that the radio station
starts with begins to play

836
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:28,577
so this is a great way to tell your
users

837
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:33,640
are to recommends a certain set of
content to use

838
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:37,081
maybe they don't wanna buy it but they
want to listen to music that inspired by

839
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:40,082
a particular artist or song you can

840
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:43,154
get them into the iTunes radio I
experience

841
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:47,353
and listening to music immediately

842
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,500
best serve all this is supported with
the affiliate program

843
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:56,474
with the same terms and everything else
7 percent over 24 hours

844
00:50:56,969 --> 00:51:01,040
and that applies not just to purchases
made within the iTunes radio app

845
00:51:01,004 --> 00:51:04,803
but any other store on that same device
for the cookie exists

846
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:08,060
so that means music of course perhaps
books

847
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:13,070
movies all the rest are all supported
under the affiliate program

848
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:17,030
now to constructed a link to iTunes
radio

849
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:20,190
we've added some functionality to the
search and look up API's

850
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:25,014
so that the concert result that you see
will have links to the radio stations

851
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:26,140
themselves

852
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:32,113
so here we're looking for and Sharon and
in the result set that we get back

853
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,544
we're looking for an artist

854
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:41,020
the jason has a radio station URL and
you can use that special URL

855
00:51:41,002 --> 00:51:44,017
to launch into the iTunes radio

856
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:48,020
application you would of course have to
add your affiliated to the sea world

857
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,004
we've been discussing

858
00:51:49,004 --> 00:51:52,153
sightings radio I its

859
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:55,790
great setup music for you it uses to

860
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:01,143
person to and you get a bonus for any
purchases made after clicking that link

861
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:05,662
way to end up talking today about
collections

862
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:10,056
and collections are something you might
be familiar with

863
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,310
from previous talks used to be called
web I mix

864
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:16,093
but this is a dynamic playlists

865
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:19,117
that is to find entirely by URL

866
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:23,666
and here's what it looks like this is a
collection we've defined by creating a

867
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:24,823
special URL

868
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:27,863
and we've set the title

869
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:31,640
we said description now there's a limit
on

870
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,064
what kinda text you can put in the
description but its

871
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:38,073
fairly broad and finally we can actually
define

872
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:41,432
the content I love the playlist itself

873
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:45,098
so here we've got four songs by Ed
Sheeran

874
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:49,480
on and you can buy you to these
individually

875
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:52,069
or tap a single click and by the whole
thing

876
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:55,218
om I want so

877
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,865
how do we do this the to do

878
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,170
to create a collection like you need to
set something up forehand

879
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:05,706
on which you need in addition to the
normal affiliate sign up

880
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:09,190
is to I get a special collection

881
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,038
account with us we will tell you

882
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:15,897
a special web developer I D and a shared
secret

883
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,337
in the shared secret is used to
cryptographically sign these URL's

884
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:25,250
so that we know who the author is up
that title and description and

885
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:28,624
the content

886
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:31,920
collections support Songz albums

887
00:53:31,092 --> 00:53:34,241
movies TV shows music videos you can
have

888
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:38,790
kind of a wide-ranging set of content
that you're going to have and this could

889
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,091
actually be pretty high value if you

890
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:44,127
if you know your user is interested and
six different movies

891
00:53:45,027 --> 00:53:49,126
and their they're ready to buy the ready
to go you can put a single link in front

892
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:49,375
of them

893
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:53,050
and they can buy six movies with one tap
at back

894
00:53:53,779 --> 00:53:59,290
can mean a lot of money I in terms of
commissions

895
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:02,748
up to get started with the collection
system you you there's a bunch of

896
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:04,940
documentation available online

897
00:54:04,094 --> 00:54:07,138
but let's take a look at what these
links actually look like on

898
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:11,104
the rather intimidating at first but we
can break them down for you

899
00:54:12,004 --> 00:54:15,042
we start with a the prefix which is

900
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:18,108
has a little bit history you web I'm X

901
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:23,014
there's the title that we defined of
course the world coated the description

902
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:26,343
is also in there and the ideas that we
wanted

903
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:29,471
I your own code again so that the

904
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:32,516
the link actually works are in there

905
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:36,759
additionally we've passed in a WD I D
that's the web developer I D

906
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:40,000
and we've signs we've done a little bit
of cryptography and we've

907
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,007
added a key to the URL and we put that
into the key parameter

908
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:47,014
and finally we've got our affiliate
soaking up at the top

909
00:54:47,077 --> 00:54:51,131
because we want to get a commission on
this link course

910
00:54:52,031 --> 00:54:55,127
so this is a great way to make things
happen on the fly if your user

911
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:59,090
has a special set of desires that you
know about

912
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:02,094
you can put together a single collection
with this on the fly

913
00:55:03,075 --> 00:55:06,167
you don't need to do you need to
register a particular collection

914
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:11,756
beforehand once you're signed up you can
do this anytime you want

915
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,670
on the other hand maybe you don't wanna
have the difficulty of defining these

916
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,766
URL's programmatically

917
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:21,150
for that we have collection builder and
