1
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:14,144
Hyatt hello and welcome to the for
advanced graphics animations

2
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:15,137
fly with

3
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:20,053
ok I'm XO up next over there he will
take over in the middle of the talk

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,135
and was to less talky going to cover the
following topics:

5
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:27,086
the first part will be talking about the
quantitation pipeline and how it

6
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:28,114
interacts with the application

7
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:32,069
after this I'm introduce a few rendering
concept that are required to understand

8
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:35,136
our new two classes you I blow effect
and you have RNC affect

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,042
and after this Michael takeover and
walking through existing profiling tools

10
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:45,121
and demonstrate a few case studies 2282
framework to be looking at and at a

11
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,114
distance talk

12
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,075
from in the hospital to top you looking
at coordination and how to interact with

13
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:50,147
OpenGL

14
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:54,776
on some hardware was metal with the
graphics software and then

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,720
in the second half of my part I will
talk about you I blow effect on your lap

16
00:00:58,072 --> 00:00:59,128
and the fact that a part of you like it

17
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:03,807
so let's get started with the
coordination pipeline

18
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,580
so it's all starting the application

19
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:10,094
the application with a few high keep
either indirectly with you like it or

20
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:11,148
directly to score animation

21
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:16,050
one thing was not a thing now is that
the application process

22
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:19,136
is actually not doing the actual
rendering work for coordination instep

23
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:20,069
this

24
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,166
few Arceus committed to UN a suburb just
a separate process

25
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:27,120
and israel also has a server-side
version of coordination that receives

26
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:28,080
this your lucky

27
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:31,153
if your keys then rendered visco
animation

28
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:36,065
miss orange elemental on this trip you
few accelerated

29
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:39,143
and then one secure key is being
rendered we can finally displayed to the

30
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:40,047
user

31
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:44,107
so do you think interesting part is now
haha doesn't look like time by

32
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:47,098
submitting the application so therefore
I would like to introduce the flow

33
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:47,181
Ingrid

34
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,109
the vertical lines represent a vertical
blanking interrupts

35
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,072
and and surrendering at 60 Hertz are you
I the distance between doors

36
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:59,085
article and 16.67 milliseconds saw

37
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,108
the full thing that happens in the
application be receive an event

38
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:06,036
probably because a touch and therefore
the usual case

39
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:09,105
but anything to hell in this case is
that the 12 update a few hockey

40
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,474
and this happens in the face that we
call the contraction faces in

41
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,610
Mizuno application at the end of the
faith

42
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:20,580
if you are keys then and cold and sent
Reynoso

43
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,201
the full thing that are in the summer
and assist is the coldest you are a key

44
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,700
the end the summer then has to wait for
the next piece Inc

45
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:32,076
in order to made for bus that we get
back what state you can actually render

46
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:33,170
to

47
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:36,556
and then it finally stopped issuing draw
calls

48
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:42,680
to for the Jeep you with OpenGL metal
again then want this is completed

49
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:45,145
hopefully teach PDP resources not
available we can finally start rendering

50
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:50,144
and soldier accused of doing is
rendering work hopefully this rendering

51
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:51,060
rock

52
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:54,029
finishes before the next we think
because then we can

53
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:57,458
swap in the frame buffer and showed if
you are key to the user

54
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,813
as you can see this very steps spent
over mood for frames in this case it's

55
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,510
three frames

56
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,980
and let's say we would now lost continue
with the next 10 leavin to commit

57
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:06,492
transaction

58
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,930
after-hours played that we would only be
able to her and that when he heard not

59
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:09,932
at 60 Hertz

60
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:13,783
so therefore what we're doing is BR
overlaying

61
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:16,975
the stages so in parallel with the drugs
that you can see here we will

62
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,637
do the next 10-20 vent and the event
commit transaction and so we end up with

63
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:26,332
this following step diagram in next few
slight I would like to

64
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,060
focus on you commit transaction stage
because that's what effect the

65
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,405
application developers the most

66
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,790
so let's take a look at commit
transaction

67
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,088
commit transaction itself consists of
four fails the first base this delay of

68
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:38,846
faith

69
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,325
does let me set up the fuse then the
next phase is to display faced this is a

70
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:43,915
draw to fuse

71
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,230
the sub faces steep repair commit face
levy

72
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,542
to some additional 20 mission work and
the last faces

73
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:54,790
maybe actually pick it up the Laos and
seventh-rounder so

74
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,478
in the comet let's look in detail at
those four phases

75
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,290
first the layout faith and layout faced
the layout the fuse alright I invoked

76
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:07,029
there's a few creation happens doesn't
let me at least

77
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:11,258
sure keep stats a few and is very
popular content and to some lightweight

78
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,547
database lookup something like this
because we don't want to stall here too

79
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:14,841
long

80
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:18,680
like this could be for example localized
strings because we need him at this

81
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:19,347
point in order to put

82
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,500
to a labor layout because of this the
face is usually Cebu bond oil bound

83
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:28,007
the second phase of the display faith a

84
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:31,080
disadvantage or contents the store
activity overridden audio stream drawing

85
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:35,242
one thing what both noting here is that
this

86
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,110
face is actually Cebu on a rebound
because the rendering is so for us to

87
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:40,105
rise to use here

88
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:44,011
cool graphics was rendering and Soviet
leaders rendering with

89
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:48,130
CG context so the point is here that we
want to minimize the work that we do

90
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:52,342
with the quad graphics to avoid the
large performance in the stage

91
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,690
next faithful to prepare faced this is
the image decoding image conversion

92
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,328
happens

93
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,410
image tickling should be straightforward
the 75th any images and if you are a key

94
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:02,137
and

95
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:06,106
this trip XO PNG's I getting the call it
at this point

96
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,545
image conversion it's not quite so
straightforward what happens here is

97
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,624
that we might have images that I love
politics cheated on that is not

98
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:14,946
supported by the GP you

99
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:19,110
and definitely need to convert these
images a good example is could be

100
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:23,096
indexed bitmaps leave want to avoid
certain image formats

101
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:26,335
a in the last phase the cliff face the
package up the layers and send him to

102
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,620
run the server

103
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,331
this process is because if you have to
trade with really a tree and is

104
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,360
expensive their trees complex or do
that's why we want to keep the late

105
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,087
response as possible

106
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:42,130
to make sure that that it's part of the
faces is as efficient as can be

107
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:46,272
so let's take a look at this works
animation animations themself

108
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:50,220
three-stage process two of those happen
in fact application

109
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:54,053
at the last eight happens on the run the
server the first eight is very crickets

110
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,122
where we create animation update of your
key this happens usually was the

111
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:58,621
animators duration:

112
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,690
animations Meffert then the second stage
is that we

113
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,165
prepared committee animation this is
well able to fuse been called and

114
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,454
direct and that promise of familiar and
it is because

115
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,430
is out for fails we are just looking at

116
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:15,932
the only difference here is that with
the committee don't just committed if

117
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,960
you are a key

118
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:20,096
recommit as well D animation and it's a
reason because he would like to hand off

119
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:23,190
the animation work to render so I'll so
that we can

120
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,010
continue to update your animations
result using inter-process communication

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,071
to talk back to the application of
awesome backed with the application

122
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:35,122
so that's what the efficiency reasons

123
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:39,961
saw let's take a look at a few rendering
conflict the required to have

124
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:45,250
understand and you visual effects that
yet providing you with what I was 8

125
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:48,194
so it is part of a talker and covering
three areas first time with mentoring is

126
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,590
how or GP was work

127
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:53,888
then I'm going to introduce the concept
of render passes because on effects use

128
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,180
mood for in the path of

129
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:59,877
and then I'm doing a first example by
showing you home asking works is when a

130
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,111
path

131
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,759
so let's take a look at times rendering
was famous for entering the screen is

132
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,806
split into title and by and pixels

133
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,520
have put your screen shot together and
all it that the grits bacon he actually

134
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:12,011
bought it has

135
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,522
sites would be like the title virtual so
that it fits into

136
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:22,490
into the SLC cash and the ID is here
that the geometry split 2-2 tie buckets

137
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:27,278
and I would like to demonstrate this a
using the phone taken as an example

138
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:30,751
as you can see the full I can spend
smokes but I'll and

139
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,120
before I can tell has read it as a
seattle-area and the CLA NCAA israel's

140
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,020
two triangles and if you look at the two
triangles

141
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:42,053
they're still spending multiple
triangles earth in with the tiles

142
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:45,032
and thought if you were doing now it
will not stop splitting up those trying

143
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:46,090
of

144
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,558
many committed but I'll so that each
type can be rented individually

145
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
the idea fear the beard do with process
novel who geometry so at some point we

146
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,648
have to do a tree for each to collect it
and then we can make decisions

147
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,740
on what pics a visible and then decide
but picks a chair to run three-run each

148
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:03,373
pixel shader when he wants

149
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,620
pics obviously if you do banning this
doesn't quite work

150
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:12,391
then we still have to you problem
overdrawn

151
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,340
so let's take a look at what type up
when Rick passes I'll

152
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:19,673
so little few obligation has but if
you're keeping score animation

153
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,210
it's committed to render so and comic
when mission you call it it

154
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:27,077
ans now it needs to end it and it will
use OpenGL metal

155
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:30,696
in this light I'm just saying metal for
simplicity trend it

156
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,020
and it will generate with openelec
amount of it is then submitted to GP you

157
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:41,151
at the GQ oops receive this command
perform and stop doing it work

158
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,810
the first thing that you do is what text
processing is that about the chat around

159
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:47,103
and ID issue that could transform all
about this isn't a screen space at this

160
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:49,005
stage

161
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:52,042
so that we can do tend to the second
stage with those bitches get retailing

162
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,201
many actually tell the geometry fought
advocates

163
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:59,570
and this part of the stage is called but
I left side you will be able to find

164
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:02,111
in the instruments in the open OpenGL ES
driver instrument

165
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:06,110
under tell you to as Asian

166
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,750
the output of the state's is written and
something called a parent about from

167
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:12,075
and the next stage is not starting
millions that

168
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:15,161
the leave made no answer or geometry is
processed and sits in the palatable for

169
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:19,079
or into the pan with a purpose for
because the problem is is a public bus

170
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,147
will be have to flush it

171
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,093
and it's actually performance it on
because then we need to start over text

172
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:24,160
processing

173
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:28,101
and gets front load the pic social
network

174
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:34,334
and next set say that stages as a set up
extra stage

175
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:37,860
the state is actually call to render a
stage and you can find again in the

176
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,141
instrument so popular private school

177
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,430
and the name when the rate was Asian and
the output of the stage is written to

178
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:44,120
something called

179
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,031
you in the buffer K

180
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:52,073
so that's take a look at a practical
example by looking at masking

181
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:55,075
let's assume of your keys way to go the
command buffer is

182
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:58,081
sitting mister review and you can stop
processing

183
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,060
so the full thing happens in the fourth
pastors that be rendered the

184
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:06,020
delay I'm off to a texture in this case
with this camera icon

185
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:09,138
them in the second path P render the
their content to a texture

186
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:13,092
and in this case with this kinda blew
material

187
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:16,871
and then in the last part that he called
it compositing possibly apply to master

188
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:18,718
the content texture

189
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,260
and composite to rate the result is
green and up is dis light blue camera

190
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:24,795
icon

191
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,100
saw let's take a look at you I blew a
factor for those that don't know

192
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:32,042
you I blow effect can be used with you
as a visual effect few and

193
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:37,570
does not public API since I was 8 it
basically allows you to use to growth

194
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:42,250
that introduces I was having and be
providing you with three different law

195
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,604
stuff that I want to demonstrate your

196
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:47,820
took this regular i worth wallpaper and
apply to three blocks that that you have

197
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:47,141
to it

198
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,470
X the light light and dark a

199
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,420
so let's take a look how does look
performance wife

200
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:58,093
I'm using Google Docs time as an example
for rendering process the doc style

201
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:01,096
actually using the law of the model
friend apostles and

202
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:05,002
the I think your mind number in the past
depends on how to be different not

203
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:06,360
imitation

204
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:09,129
for certain puff puff up via

205
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,123
for the fourth past year end of the
content that is going to be blood

206
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:18,252
then in the second part of be captured a
confident on scale it

207
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,515
the downscale depends on the hardware so
in disc fly to cap it at a certain sites

208
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,082
with the readable

209
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,180
then in like the past the apply the
actual blog arisen which

210
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:31,097
separated so we do first horizontal and
vertical

211
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:35,101
does actually a con brio optimization be
quick to listen thing a path but let's

212
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,004
assume our

213
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:40,037
blower car would be eleven by 11 this
would mean we would need to read had a

214
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:42,038
twenty one samples per pixel

215
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:45,346
by separating its we only need to read
11 samples per pixel

216
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,870
cage past so after the 4th path we have
tooth

217
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:52,138
love horizontally and vertically blot
small tiny area

218
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:56,747
and so what's left in the last part is
that need to upscale display or intended

219
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,144
in this case we end up there with our
doctor

220
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,940
so that looks fine but let's take a look
how this looks like performance wise

221
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:08,683
so what it as a test I critical full
screen layout and

222
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,810
applied to your bluff effect to it and
measure the performance and a staggering

223
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:16,290
can see three roles the first role we
present a tile activity

224
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,600
the second row interactivity and to the
last row I put in the black interrupt

225
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,038
you can actually see you

226
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:26,321
what our friend boundaries are and again
be running at 60 votes are you I

227
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:31,236
so time you have 16.67 milliseconds

228
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,490
so let's focus on a on a single frame

229
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:39,148
if you can see a first look here the
first Tyler path is happening before the

230
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,670
first when their path and that's because

231
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:44,093
the Thailand supporters all geometries
with emphasize what we just saw in the

232
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:46,422
previous lights

233
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:50,260
so let's go quickly what passes against
the footpath is the

234
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,307
content past time for this penance
really depends really on if you are a

235
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:54,698
key

236
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,178
in this case it's just a simple image so
it might take longer in use in

237
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,160
real-world

238
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:03,505
you I'm then in the second panel 3
downscale

239
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,704
and capture the content it's actually
fairly fast

240
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,199
at his pre-match consul cost then

241
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,800
the surpasses yours on to blow it again
constant calls for to pre fast because

242
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:13,051
the

243
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:17,632
only played on a very small area and
then in the fourth past

244
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,190
me to refer to comply or again very fast
and

245
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:25,168
we end up with a blow to region and then
in the last past the upscale

246
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:28,364
and tint people are

247
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,595
the one thing you will notice now others
gaps between those passes left my time

248
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:32,687
here in Orange

249
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,660
and does get I actually did you idle
time and to happen because we do here

250
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,068
rent a context switch

251
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:40,985
here on this John a jeep you and this
can actually quite at up quite quickly

252
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,842
because the time spent here as I times
per possible to your point want to

253
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,550
your point to a few seconds Saunders
cases for passes we have got at the time

254
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:51,834
of 0.4 to 0.8 milliseconds

255
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:57,930
which is a good thing if you can track
of our 16.67 milliseconds

256
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:00,119
let's take a look out a bill performs on
the various devices um

257
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,098
so again this is the full screen blow to
use that I used before and

258
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:07,397
admitted as well on iPad 3 such
innovation

259
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,040
and as you can see the iPod Touch
generation performs much worse than the

260
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:12,803
iPad app

261
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,470
in the induced in the in the case of
text the lead lawyer the timing

262
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:20,113
is 18 point 15 me second full week and
render 60% of this type of Braun iPad 2

263
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:21,100
a.m.

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,329
and polite and actually a around
fourteen point five milliseconds

265
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,980
which leads us about 20 seconds for you
i've which is not really enough a

266
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:30,077
rendering any compelling you I

267
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,430
for the decision be made on I was 7
corey was that we would is able to blow

268
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:35,067
on certain devices

269
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,068
and the iPod Touch generation is one of
the few bystanders this

270
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:41,085
the former on about situation changes to
this

271
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:44,884
basically just apply it in play on top
so that we can actually do believe he is

272
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:46,470
the same as

273
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:49,726
with possibly effects

274
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,185
saw and to elaborate on what devices we
don't want to be only 22 tinting

275
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:59,370
on the iPad 2 and iPad such generational
be just apply the tent and be skipped

276
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,366
the blow steps

277
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,704
on iPad 4th generation iPod air iPad
Mini iPad Mini

278
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,268
was richard is playing or iPhones and
the iPod Touch do both the Bryant

279
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,680
attending

280
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:14,337
soul in summary for the you I visual
effect few with you I play fact

281
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:18,031
you have no effect it would have on
screen passes depending on the style

282
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,831
why don't you weep sorry drawn so it's
actually fine if you have

283
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,810
a large blur area and you don't update
content behind it because we only apply

284
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:26,420
to once

285
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,243
effect is very costly so the United can
be easily Jeep you belong to

286
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,183
so therefore you should keep the balance
of the few s smallest possible

287
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:40,690
and therefore as well he should make
sure to budget for defect

288
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:43,078
saw next let's take a look at the UI
violence effect

289
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,620
you haven't the effect is a is an
effective use on top of the bro and it's

290
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:49,093
meant to be useful content which can
make sure that content than out and

291
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,129
doesn't go unnoticed Bros

292
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,378
so let's take a look how does look like
at this hour three blocks that again

293
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,810
and let's assume the bonds to render the
camera taken from I'm asking example

294
00:15:59,081 --> 00:15:59,860
from before

295
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:05,370
on top and this could look like this if
you don't use any balance effect and as

296
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:07,006
you can see with the lights style

297
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,440
there might be too large booty issues
because the great stuff leading

298
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:13,673
out so what decided to us that we edit
some

299
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:17,160
if I'm into effect and the primacy
effect and at the punch through and then

300
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:20,037
you end up with nice private look

301
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:23,040
saw let's take a look how does affect
performance

302
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:26,486
so back to or in the past agro

303
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:31,490
the first five passes are in this case
for the doctor or the broadcast

304
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:35,008
and then in a six pack of beer and other
their content to a texter

305
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:38,507
and then in the final compositing pass
we take the

306
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,980
their content and apply filter and
composited on top of the blow

307
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:45,103
don't be fooled here from for the cause
actually quite expensive and I wanna

308
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:50,054
shoulders and next couple of flights

309
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:54,033
so this is our order and I come from
before the the the steps for to blow and

310
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,810
lets at on now the steps for the
vibrancy effect

311
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:01,480
so in perfect a meeting in here from
content that is ok amer-i-can

312
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,221
and damn obviously the cost for this
past depends on what you're entering

313
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:06,880
their

314
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:09,547
but very few very few have key looks
like

315
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,280
and then last past the apply the filter
and as you can see for the cause

316
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:16,030
actually very expand the fifth to
actually the most expensive path we have

317
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,084
here

318
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:21,730
one thing to keep in mind here is that I
apply to balance the effect of which can

319
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,010
carry on

320
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,670
the recommendation is to not apply to
pharmacy effect with with Marion stat to

321
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:32,691
only apply it to us more content areas
to avoid to tissues performance penalty

322
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,020
about and his life a the did you have no
spam or caps because you have more in

323
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:39,033
the past us or the G two at a time

324
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:44,098
has increased as well if not six caps
and this can add up to 0.6 pool 21.2 mi

325
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:44,151
seconds

326
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:48,082
by the time about you

327
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,108
saw let's take a look how does look on
my part such innovation and

328
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:57,077
iPad a.m. does the base cost from before
4.59 many seconds for the iPod situation

329
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,084
we don't blow

330
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:02,140
and a different times for the iPad and
depending on the blast I'll

331
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:07,038
solar at the on and what we can see is
for the fourth benefactors step your

332
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:11,076
spending on iPad saturation about 27 to
26 milliseconds just

333
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:15,103
for applying the vibrancy effect on the
iPad

334
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:19,074
air we spend about 17.48 me second
flexalite style and

335
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:23,090
around 40 milliseconds for light and oxo
you don't have a lot of time left on a

336
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,398
gp2 any other rendering

337
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:29,080
I mean 22nd from the best case here
sought to emphasize again we should

338
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,045
really restrictive I'm into effect on a
small area to avoid is huge

339
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:35,112
keep your head so in summary

340
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:39,033
the UI vibrancy effect at to a screen
pass earth

341
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:42,097
2 I'm into effect use expensive company
is an expensive compositing for the full

342
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:43,133
content

343
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:47,262
therefore we should all you survive into
effect on the small regions

344
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,657
arm again like the blonde only to return
to read wrong

345
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,690
and you I'm into effect is very costly
on all devices

346
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:57,110
so with Les Mis the Blue Earth you I can
easily be G view bound

347
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:01,053
keep the bounds of the fuse a small as
possible I make sure to

348
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:04,065
budget for defects so

349
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:06,134
next I would like to give a couple of
optimization techniques take the

350
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:09,076
techniques on the way I want is worth
relation

351
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:12,153
isolation can be used to composite which
once was the Jeep you

352
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:16,122
this can be neighbors they should trust
their eyes property on a clar and

353
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,023
a few things to keep in mind when doing
this first

354
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:23,032
extra of composite a creative in the
update the content solutions

355
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:26,033
only used it for static content secondly

356
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:29,124
you should I use it because the cache
size for us relations limited to 25.5

357
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:31,583
times of the screen size

358
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,230
so if you start setting dress dress
property of on last part of your

359
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:38,058
few hockey you might lower the cash over
and over and end up as a lot of

360
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:38,063
additional

361
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:42,057
ski passes last a

362
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,085
arrest was impressed with images I
because from the couch if they are you

363
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:47,044
someone how many seconds

364
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:50,810
so you wanna make sure that he used is
only for images are consciously use them

365
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:51,390
up for

366
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,198
entry please let me just because then
you will Inc you every time in a screen

367
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,580
pass

368
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:59,109
so typically use cases are to avoid
ridge or redrawing expensive

369
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,072
effect of that the content so you could
rest rice for example a blow

370
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:06,114
and the other thing is to have what we
doing a complex Trk so we could

371
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:12,283
breast rice for few are key in composite
is on top of a blog wonderbra

372
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:15,473
so the last thing I have here is
capacity

373
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,135
capacity can be disabled list the last
capacity property ICAO

374
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:24,580
a capacity but actually in terms of kim
possible a it's not a pixels means

375
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:29,072
your past the property is not equal 1.0
and for last long trip the contents

376
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:32,411
that means that if China Laos or a
background image and

377
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,480
but isn't on the status of your account
to be composited before it's being

378
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:36,133
blended

379
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:40,094
and if America nations with turn it off
it's not needed

380
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:44,463
be very careful is this was this I would
like to rent or to Mike

381
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:52,160
42

382
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:56,089
so I am i crossing software engineer on
the island on Steam

383
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:00,134
and the first thing on talk about are
tools so

384
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:05,041
before I get into tools though I do want
to mention prompt investigation lighter

385
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,047
so basically what are the questions
running through my head when

386
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,886
I encounter performance issue and want
to start tracking down the source about

387
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,620
so first thing I want to know is what is
the frame right

388
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:18,063
you know it's always good to know where
you're starting performance wise so that

389
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:20,161
you can gauge how the changes you make
are affecting performance

390
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:25,760
so our goal is always 60 frames per
second we want to ensure that we have

391
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,570
smooth scrolling and I smooth animations

392
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:31,896
to provide a good user experience so our
target should always be 60 frames per

393
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:34,600
second next up

394
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:38,215
I wanna know are we see peerage if you
down you know obviously the

395
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:42,620
slow realization the better because will
let us had our performance targets

396
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:47,146
and also give us better battery life
netting 10

397
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:51,083
other any unnecessary is there any
unnecessary CP rendering

398
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,146
so basically are we overriding drummer
somewhere where we really shouldn't be

399
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:59,145
you know kind understanding what
rendering and how rendering

400
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,594
we want the Jeep you to do is much add
this as make sense next thing on a No

401
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:08,947
is do we have too many offspring passes
as actual pointed out previously

402
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:13,700
of green passes basically give the Jeep
you idle time because I have to contact

403
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:13,065
switches

404
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:17,927
so we want to have fewer offspring
passes fewer the better

405
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,330
next up I wanna know is there too much
blending in the Y

406
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:25,132
on we obviously want to do last funding
because blending

407
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,530
is more expensive for the Jeep you to do
then rendering

408
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:31,084
as normal a player so responding better

409
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:35,803
next I want to know is are there any
strange image formats were sizes

410
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,240
basically want to avoid on-the-fly
conversion image formats

411
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:44,048
as I 2.0 previously if you are

412
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:47,049
rendering an image that is not in the
color for me that's not supported by the

413
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:47,122
Jeep you

414
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:52,096
then it has to be converted by the CPU
and so we want to try and wait anything

415
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:53,112
on the fly like that

416
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:58,058
next up on an order any expensive user a
fax

417
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:01,083
learn vibrancy are awesome but we want
to make sure that we're using them

418
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,110
sparingly in a way

419
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:07,006
that will give us the sprawling
performance that we want and lastly

420
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:11,006
oh noes or anything unexpected in the
view hierarchy on you know

421
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:14,035
if you have a situation we are
constantly adding removing views you

422
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,137
know you could introduce a bike
accidentally that's a

423
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,226
you know insert a nation forgets to
remove them or

424
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,100
you know your adding use your harking
forgetting to remove them you know you

425
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,060
wanna make sure the only have the views
that you really need

426
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:30,098
mom you know in your heart key because
you want to avoid excessive CPU use a

427
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:30,187
back forty

428
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:35,136
so now let's get into some other tools
that will give us the answers to these

429
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:36,102
questions

430
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:40,087
so first up on talk about instruments
and particularly will talk about

431
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,100
are the coronation instrument in the
OpenGL ES driver instrument

432
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,088
then I will say a few things about the
simulator that you can do with color

433
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:47,171
debug options

434
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:51,790
and I will briefly talk about a new
feature in Xcode

435
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:57,710
for life you debugging device so first
up

436
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:01,073
a if you want instruments and select the
coronation temple

437
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,165
that will give you a document that
contains

438
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:09,139
a coronation instrument and a time
profiler instrument if you select the

439
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,071
coronation instrument

440
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:14,108
you can then choose which is the six you
wanna show

441
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:18,029
in this case it's only frames per second

442
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:22,288
so will choose that and then when you
take a trace it will show you your frame

443
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:26,010
rate so you can see in the column here
shows you the frames per second

444
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:30,027
for each interval this trace was running
for you see this in sample intervals

445
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:33,114
likewise wanna see what the CPU's doing

446
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:38,533
are you can select the time profiler
instrument and so you slept

447
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:41,750
and you can then see an aggregate the
call stack

448
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:44,126
what the CPU was doing while you were
taking a trace

449
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,109
so this is where you would look for you
know I am i overriding drive rack too

450
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,094
much spending too much time in a
threatening

451
00:24:50,094 --> 00:24:54,171
thread doing things that I shouldn't be
next up let's talk about some other

452
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:59,073
color debug options that are part of the
coronation instrument so if you select

453
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:00,089
the coronation instrument

454
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:03,152
you can see the color debug options over
here on the right

455
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:08,078
so let's go through what those are first
up

456
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:12,079
we have color-blind players and so this
will tent this will 10 players

457
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,126
green better appcake and two players red
have to be blinded

458
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:20,038
as we said previously you know layers
that have to be blended is more work for

459
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:20,807
the Jeep you

460
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:24,450
and so you ideally want to see less red

461
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:28,048
you know and more green but there are
gonna be cases where you can avoid it

462
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:32,054
on for example in this particular case
we have a white people view

463
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:36,027
with my table who sells and we noticed
that our labels

464
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:40,101
are you know how many people ended here
so if we made our labels in this case

465
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:44,072
opaque then we wouldn't have to worry
about doing the blending

466
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:48,077
on so that would be one opposition we
can make in this particular case

467
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:54,023
next up color hit screens and missus red
this shows you how you're using or

468
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:54,122
abusing

469
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:59,023
on the should Rasta rise property on see
a liar

470
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:04,059
so what this will do is it will it will
tense cash it's green cache misses red

471
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,066
so you know as a 2.0 previously keep in
mind that your cache size is only two

472
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:09,138
and a half sine

473
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:13,440
times the size of the screen and items
are affected from the cash if they're

474
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:14,814
not used than a hundred milliseconds

475
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:19,370
so you know it's good to use this
particular coloring about option to see

476
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,220
how the cow you're utilizing the cash
with

477
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:26,109
you know what you have such a rush to
respond

478
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:30,035
when you first launcher app you're going
to see a lot of flashing red because you

479
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,099
obviously have to render it once before
to be cash

480
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:35,134
but after that you don't wanna see a
whole lotta flashes a red because

481
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:39,038
you know as we have previously you know
any thing you're doing is going to incur

482
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:40,013
of green passes

483
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,530
you have to render a and then stick it
in cash

484
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:47,055
so next item is color copied images

485
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:51,232
on you as we said before if an image is
in a format as in the color format

486
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:54,980
that the chief you can't work directly
with it will have to be converted by the

487
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:55,517
CPU

488
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:59,710
so in this particular example you know
this is a simple

489
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:04,073
far photo browsing arm were just getting
images from an online source more not

490
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,232
really checking her size

491
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:10,230
or their or their color format on its
own if it were case we're getting images

492
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:11,109
that are 16 bits per component

493
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:16,038
and so you can see that they are tinted
sign here that is telling us that these

494
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:19,038
images had to be converted by the CPU
and commit phase

495
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,077
before they can actually be rendered so
you know for this

496
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:24,946
particular case we don't want to do this
on the fly because I will fax growing

497
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:26,643
performance

498
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,240
on with so you can beforehand

499
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:34,029
you know convert your images to the size
and color format you're expecting

500
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:37,493
and it's best to do this in you in the
background so you're not eating up time

501
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,570
on the main thread while you're trying
to scroll or doing other things

502
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:45,152
so the next option is color misaligned
images this will tent

503
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:49,129
images yellow that are being scaled and
10 images purple

504
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:53,036
that are not pixel on you know as it had
previously it's always good to make sure

505
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:55,184
that images are in the color format and
size that you want

506
00:27:56,084 --> 00:27:59,133
because the last thing you want to be
doing is you know doing conversions and

507
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:00,770
scaling

508
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:03,121
on the fly while you're scrolling so the
same prince will be applied

509
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:07,057
in the previous light will also apply
here to get rid of the scaling

510
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:10,074
why so next up

511
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:14,076
is color of green yellow so this will 10
layers yellow

512
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:17,077
based on the number of green passes that
each layer

513
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:21,159
occurs so be more yellow you see the
more of green passes we have

514
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,153
if you notice the NAP are and the
toolbar are tinted yellow

515
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:29,082
that's because there are pillars with
these layers that are

516
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,290
actually learn the concept behind it so
we expect those but I do find it curious

517
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,035
that the images

518
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:38,052
are having offering passes so we'll take
a look at that later on the presentation

519
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:41,084
and see how to work around this issue

520
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:44,423
so next is collar opened your fast path
blue

521
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,241
and so what this will do is this will 10
layers blue that are being planted by

522
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,805
the display hardware

523
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,710
this is actually a good thing you wanna
see because if we have content with

524
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:56,540
being bent blinded by the display
hardware

525
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,270
the Nets less work for the Jeep you have
to do so in this case if you see

526
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,426
something show up in blue

527
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,780
that's a good thing on

528
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:07,175
last option is flash up the two regions
and so what this will do is it will

529
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:08,119
flash

530
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:13,032
her to the screen yellow that are being
updated on this particular example is

531
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:14,391
with the clocks out that shit

532
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,010
in iowa's are you notice that the yellow
regions here

533
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:23,790
are the second-hand ideally you only
want to see

534
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,190
part to the screen flashing yellow the
you're actually updating again because

535
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:28,238
that means less work for the

536
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:33,200
GP you must work the CPU so if you turn
this on you don't want to see

537
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:36,111
a lot a flashing yellow unless you
actually are updating

538
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:40,740
that much of the screen so in summary

539
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:44,107
are some questions that the coronation
instrument will help you get to

540
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:48,078
he will help you figure with free
murders is there any unnecessary CP

541
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,082
rendering because

542
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:52,130
it does include the time profiler
instrument

543
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:56,081
and also with the colored by the options
you can see are things like other too

544
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:59,052
many offering passes how much when
things going on

545
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:04,671
and you have an East strange image
format your size is that not expecting

546
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:08,320
and so one additional point on corn
options some

547
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:11,341
love the color and options are available
in the eye with simulator so you can see

548
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:13,190
the example here

549
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,023
a few things to point out with this the

550
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,070
colors might be slightly different
because the version CA that's running

551
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:23,090
inside the simulators actually person at
the aid atlanta with 10 on iowa's

552
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:27,060
so if you see any discrepancies always
trust what you see on device

553
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:31,172
because that your customers actually
gonna be using arm

554
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:34,730
so this is a good future because you can
have you like for your testing team go

555
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:34,772
off

556
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:39,570
and poke around your app and see if you
have any unexpected offering passes or

557
00:30:39,057 --> 00:30:43,072
any conversion or anything that looks
suspicious

558
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:47,077
so next topic on talk about the OpenGL
ES driver in

559
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:51,726
so if you watch instruments and select
the OMG oh yes driver template

560
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:55,980
that will give you a document that
contains the OpenGL ES driver instrument

561
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:59,196
and and and the time profiler instrument
so if you select the OpenGL ES driver

562
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,145
instrument

563
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:06,060
you can choose from which the CITIC
Pacific's you want to actually collect

564
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:09,021
when I'm investigating things I tend to
go for

565
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,121
device utilization which will show you
how much the Jeep use in use during the

566
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:13,980
truth

567
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:17,990
i render anti realization does
correspond to the render

568
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:20,288
entirely phases that axles I talked
about previously

569
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,100
and then of course the coronation frames
per second because I want to know what

570
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:27,038
the actual frame rate is that we're
seeing

571
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:30,226
so if you take a trace

572
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,000
and then select the coroner the OpenGL
yes driver

573
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,639
instrument you can then look at the
statistics

574
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:41,000
NC throughput for example in this case
you know we are getting 60 frames per

575
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,002
second

576
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:45,371
and our device utilization is in like
the mid

577
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:49,100
lower 70's so you know depends on what

578
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,042
you are your rendering so you know you
may want to investigate this

579
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:56,055
gold like that all boils down to what
you're actually rendering for this case

580
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:59,098
and likewise since we have the time
overall arrangement here you can see

581
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:00,146
with the CPU's doing

582
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:05,072
so if you select that you can then again
look at an aggregate cost tax

583
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:08,781
what's going on in the CPU during this
time to this is always useful because

584
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,436
you can highlight certain regions

585
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,440
you know if you noticed that you're
dropping free in 3 knows a lot of

586
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:14,663
activity you can zoom in and see

587
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,140
what the CPU was doing during a
particular time

588
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:22,896
so in summary with the OpenGL ES driver
instrument you know this will give you

589
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:25,164
answers to questions like What is your
frame rate

590
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:29,390
are you can see what the CPU and CPU
were doing and you can also use the time

591
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,730
profiler instrument

592
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:35,098
to see other any unnecessary CPU
rendering going on

593
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:39,105
so next up is a really cool feature that
was added Xcode

594
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:44,051
for live you debugging on device so if
you open your project in Xcode

595
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:48,119
and then run it and then click the
Follow button on the bottom here

596
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,098
what will actually do is it will grab
the view hierarchy of the device

597
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:55,174
and you can then go poking around in a
few Archaean see what exact use are

598
00:32:56,074 --> 00:33:00,143
in your you why so this is always good
because you can expect to see as I said

599
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:01,893
if there's anything unexpected there

600
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,727
you know maybe something is building up
you have a legal thing animations or

601
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:06,960
something

602
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:09,765
or constraints so this is good to
actually see what the view hierarchy is

603
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:11,634
on your device

604
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,480
versus say what you conceptually think
it is when you're writing your co

605
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:18,127
if you select an individual item arm or

606
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,230
noonan individual view you can look at
the properties for its ok in this case

607
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,104
we selected the UI view

608
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:27,393
and you can see details about what
property in image is currently being

609
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,010
rendered by that you

610
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:35,033
so summary for exclude you debugging
this will let you poke around in your

611
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,822
view hierarchy see what's actually being
rendered on device

612
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:41,540
you know which is helpful because you
can see if you have any expensive use

613
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:44,107
are you looking at their properties yes
in with the Browns are what not

614
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:48,029
and it also good to see if you have
anything building up unexpectedly

615
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:51,398
you are key

616
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:55,090
so next up was talk about some case
studies so what I want to do with this

617
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:57,015
is i wanna talk about a couple different
scenarios

618
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:01,268
and measure performance across different
devices and then we'll figure out how we

619
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:04,040
can work around these performance
problems

620
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:07,045
and keep the same visual appearance but
you know get the performance green

621
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:12,504
we want so first up was talk about a
fictitious photo application

622
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,957
so this is just a simple application
with the table view were each table view

623
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,300
cell has

624
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:21,292
image and a couple lines attacks and
there's also a small shadow

625
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:24,646
behind each image so if we take this and
we

626
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:30,181
measure the performance on an iPhone 5
us using your computer yes driver engine

627
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,384
you know we can see that we're hitting
60 frames per second so

628
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:36,850
that's good 60 frames per second is our
target so awesome

629
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:39,284
ship it not just yet arm

630
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:43,040
we you know actually love all over
customers and we wanna make sure

631
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:46,045
everybody has a good user experience
regardless of what the bikes there on

632
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:49,046
so let's take a look at some of the
other devices that

633
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:52,094
we support in Iowa City see how to
perform it stacks up

634
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:55,101
so first off let's look at the iPod
Touch

635
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:59,014
so I'm curious what's growing feels like
a iPod Touch

636
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:03,027
so you know again we'll take your iPod
Touch and will use the OpenGL ES driver

637
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:03,122
instrument

638
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:08,108
and you know sure enough we notice our
frame rate is in the mid-thirties

639
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:13,083
which is nowhere near our target so that
would be a lousy scrolling experience

640
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:16,179
and if we look the device utilization we
see that

641
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,088
you know this is like mid to high 70's

642
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:23,990
home this strikes me is really kinda odd
because all we're doing is we're

643
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,178
screwing around a couple

644
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:29,780
image thumbnails and syntax so I don't
really expect this much

645
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:32,154
GPO activity so what sleeping figure out
what's going on here

646
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:36,069
so first thing I want to know is you
know

647
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:39,078
what's in my view our keys or anything
unexpected here so

648
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:43,597
we use the X could be bucking feature we
grab the view hierarchy

649
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:47,910
I don't really see anything surprising
here so we've got unity will you sell

650
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:48,094
with an ImageView

651
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:53,023
into labels nothing on nothing out of
the ordinary here so

652
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:57,125
receiving figure out something else so
if we use the coronation instrument

653
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:01,031
you know remembering that often passes
are expensive let's see if we had

654
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:04,088
any of being passes or unexpected and
sure enough this is the slide in a

655
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:04,143
reference

656
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:09,138
previously so you know we have of green
passes for the images

657
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:13,777
which again strike me as curious let's
take a look at the code and see what

658
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,220
we're doing how are we setting this up

659
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:19,028
so as I said each each

660
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:22,797
image from now as shadow how
regenerating

661
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:26,760
so in this case we were asking for
animation to generate shadow for us

662
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:29,088
and we're doing that just by sending
shot a radio shadow of that

663
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:32,777
you know and other properties on
basically what we're doing this

664
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:37,460
coronation have to figure out what the
shapeless shadow looks like

665
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:40,144
on me when it does this it has to take
on screen passes to render the content

666
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:43,122
and then look at the office channel
footage is rendered to figure out where

667
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,141
the shadow belongs

668
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:49,720
and then go through all the actual work
doing the the shuttle itself

669
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:52,099
is there a better way you know something
we can do to avoid this and it turns out

670
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,198
there's

671
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,940
on if we add the following line so
there's the shuttle Path property

672
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:01,103
on you know were only scrolling image
from Nelson just basically racks various

673
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:02,085
sizes

674
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:05,133
we can easily figure out you know what
the shape of the shadow needs to look

675
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,101
like because again they're all just

676
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:12,610
you know various sized rectangles are so
if we take advantage of the shadow power

677
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:15,668
property and at that to our Code

678
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,132
then coronation doesn't have to eat up
any offspring passes

679
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:23,250
to actually generate the shadows so
let's play let's make this change will

680
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,028
add this line

681
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:27,071
and let's take a look with the
coronation instrument to see

682
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:30,158
if this really did get rid of our
offering passes in sure enough it did

683
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:35,837
so this is great less often passes means
you know left idle time on the Jeep you

684
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,740
so let's take a tray since you were
strong performance looks like

685
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:43,142
so again looking an iPod Touch will use
the OpenGL ES driver instrument

686
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:47,125
and we noticed that we are indeed
hitting 60 frames per second

687
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:51,894
that's great an check out the device
utilization

688
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,120
you know we are now in like the
mid-thirties as opposed to

689
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:59,063
you know both at the mid-seventies
before

690
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:02,482
so this this is great you know less
chief you work means we're hitting a

691
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:04,230
performance targets

692
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:08,060
and also means better battery life so
that's a good thing

693
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:11,083
so awesome can we ship it now arm

694
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:15,083
not just yet we still have one more
device: we should look at

695
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:18,140
so let's take a look an iPhone 4s and
see how

696
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:22,009
scrolling is with the new changes now so

697
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:25,718
we are in fact in 50 frames per second
that's good

698
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:30,400
and again device utilization seem sane
me a 30 percent is a lot better than

699
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:31,673
mid-seventies

700
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:36,810
so to summarize when we had coronation

701
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:40,113
doing in figuring out 100 shadow for us

702
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:44,108
are you notice there's a drop of when
you look at older devices

703
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:48,012
so the iPhone 5s can handle this no
problem

704
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:51,076
but as you look at the iPhone 5 the
iPhone 4s the iPhone iPod Touch

705
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:55,088
you notice that performance drops off
because again all the devices can handle

706
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:59,119
the amount of green passes the newer
devices can and when we make this change

707
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,128
in take advantage

708
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:04,347
the shadow path property you know notice
we're hitting our target everywhere for

709
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:05,806
60 frames per second

710
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:09,740
so this is good we can ship this and
happy covers so

711
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:12,101
are so we can finally shipped so

712
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:16,052
in summary of green passes are expensive

713
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,061
you know you always want to use
coronation instruments to find out if

714
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:20,421
you had any unnecessary

715
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:24,660
our screen passes and no the API's in
the view hierarchy that you're using

716
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:29,129
to understand first things you can do to
avoid in this case it was using shut up

717
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:33,268
and as always you know measure
performance across multiple devices

718
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:37,470
you know you can see what the Jeep you
utilization is by looking at the OpenGL

719
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:41,050
ES driver internet and you can see with
the CPU is up to by using the time

720
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:42,876
profile arrangement

721
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:46,970
and as always you know again know your
view our keynote any hidden costs for

722
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:47,119
what your

723
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,168
for what you're trying to render and
this is especially true for things we

724
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,990
have inside a people who sells

725
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,133
because we want to ensure that we have
smooth scrolling so it is particularly

726
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:59,121
important with the park you build up in
a table

727
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:04,085
so next case anyone looking at is a
fictitious contact application

728
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:07,091
so again this is just a simple table
view we have

729
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:11,140
you know around from now and we have
online attacks so

730
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:15,005
not a whole lot going on here so

731
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,116
if we look at performance across
different devices we notice that you

732
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,905
know the iPhone 5s Nov 15 reading 60
frames per second

733
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:25,870
that's good but the iPhone 4s the iPod
Touch are quite

734
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:28,102
there so you know again we want
everybody to have a good user experience

735
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:31,079
regardless of the hardware that are you
think so

736
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,154
let's take a look at this and see why
we're not getting the target frame rate

737
00:40:35,054 --> 00:40:37,099
on these devices

738
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,163
so first thing I want to do is take an
open field museum delia's driver

739
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:41,115
instrument

740
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:44,023
and take a trace you know it's always
good to know where you're starting to

741
00:40:44,095 --> 00:40:47,122
the you understand how the changes you
make are affecting performance

742
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,121
so take a trace notice that are
scrolling

743
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:55,160
is you know only in the mid-forties it's
not good

744
00:40:55,016 --> 00:40:58,925
and look at the device realization that
way she was Asian is really high here

745
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:03,170
arm thats rather interesting again
because we're just rendering a couple

746
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:07,020
you know images and syntax so that that
that that would that look suspicious to

747
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:07,836
me

748
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:11,910
so we'll take a closer look again you
know we use the coronation instrument

749
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:14,115
and see if there's any unnecessary or
unexpected of green passes

750
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:18,077
so you know we noticed the images here
are

751
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:22,336
incurring often passes so kinda curious
let's take a look at how we are

752
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:23,720
rendering

753
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:28,121
and how we are setting up these round
thumbnails

754
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:32,380
so basically what we're doing is we're
starting off this particular case

755
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:35,594
we're starting off with Square
thumbnails and we are on the fly

756
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:38,863
asking for a donation to round them off
for us and we're doing this by using

757
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:41,100
corner radius and masking

758
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:44,006
on so this is worthy of being passes are
coming from so

759
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,049
you know again anything that we can do
to avoid on screen passes you know

760
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:50,070
will improve performance across all
devices

761
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,026
so is therefore is there a better way to
do this I

762
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,089
ideally if you can't regenerate your
family else round

763
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:58,958
then that would be great because and you
just be rendering images and you

764
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:01,770
wouldn't be trying to do all of this

765
00:42:01,077 --> 00:42:04,114
masking having all these often passes on
the fly

766
00:42:05,014 --> 00:42:08,088
so you know if you can pre generate them
that's great

767
00:42:08,088 --> 00:42:12,090
if you can then another trick you could
do is remember this

768
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:16,073
you I was just away table view with
white people who sells and just you know

769
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:17,182
white background

770
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,120
so we could fake it in this case you
know we could render the square content

771
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:25,100
for the square from hell and then render
a waiting for to circle on top a bit too

772
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,049
kinda

773
00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:29,077
you know in essence cutaway the rest to
the image on

774
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:31,146
this will be reducing our on screen
passes but the increasing the amount a

775
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:33,064
blending

776
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:36,120
you know but it still turns out to be a
net performance when because the Jeep

777
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:37,871
you can plan

778
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:41,190
a lot faster than it can do on screen
passes so

779
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:45,041
let's make this change %uh just doing
the you know faking it

780
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,070
and see how that affects performance so

781
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:51,032
will take an open to release driver with
a trace using your purely driver

782
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:53,097
instrument to refrain readers

783
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:56,192
and sure enough we're getting 60 frames
per second and notice how much

784
00:42:57,092 --> 00:43:00,531
last the device utilization so again
we're 30 percent

785
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,910
verses you know mid to upper eighties on
one quick word on this

786
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:08,133
on you notice before we were actually
keep you down but we weren't actually a

787
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:10,125
hundred percent for Jeep you time

788
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:14,060
that's because you know when you have
%ah screen passes there is a idle time

789
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:17,085
when the Jeep you have to change
contacts or do you switch contacts

790
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:21,073
so you know you still might be cheap you
bound but not quite

791
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:25,119
hitting 100 percent CPU usage because
the situation with offering passes so

792
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:26,378
that's

793
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:30,100
something to keep in mind so if we
summarize

794
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:33,014
performance across all the devices you
know before we

795
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:36,087
were just using masking we notice that
there was a performance drop off on all

796
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:37,094
devices

797
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:41,413
on after we made this change you know
and we made the trade offer doing having

798
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:44,650
more blending for last on screen passes

799
00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:47,104
we are now hitting 60 frames per second
everywhere which is which is good this

800
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:50,223
is what we want

801
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:53,480
so in summary notice there's a theme
here

802
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:58,063
I often passes are expensive so you know
again you can use coronation to find

803
00:43:58,063 --> 00:43:59,081
where you have any unexpected

804
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:02,160
on screen passes and you know it's
always good to know your API

805
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:06,091
used to using do to avoid them on and of
course you know

806
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:10,704
always measure performance across
different devices you know OpenGL ES

807
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:14,200
OpenGL ES driver instrument will give
you GPUs

808
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:18,004
activity and time profiler instrument
will show you CPU activity

809
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:21,051
and again you know always know what your
view hierarchy is you know if you have

810
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:22,326
any kind of strange

811
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:27,540
or was are looking performance issues

812
00:44:27,054 --> 00:44:30,054
so overall summary you know what were
the questions below our original

813
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:33,062
questions and what will be used to

814
00:44:33,062 --> 00:44:36,090
to actually find these answers so here's
a nice little table

815
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:40,088
you know it that shows what we actually
used to get down to the question so

816
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,143
this is always a good starting point for
figuring out before you start digging

817
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:46,050
your code try to figure out what's going
on it's good to see what's actually

818
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:50,089
happening on device

819
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:53,288
so overall summary axle

820
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:58,400
talked about the coronation pipeline and
talk about some rendering concepts

821
00:44:58,004 --> 00:45:01,011
and then talked about new UI kit
features for

822
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:05,063
blur and vibrancy a fact and then I went
over profiling tools

823
00:45:05,063 --> 00:45:08,162
and then this an example case studies

824
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:12,065
so if you have any questions feel free
to contact either the app framework

825
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:14,108
evangelist or the developer tools
Angeles

826
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:19,247
so feel free to contact Jay per day if
you're curious about coordination

827
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:20,330
documentation

828
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:26,058
that available online as well as the
devil performs as a great resource

829
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:30,507
and other related sessions are happening
at the BBC you might find it interesting

830
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:34,460
so these might be worth checking out

831
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,695
so thanks and have a wonderful
