1
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:16,033
either my name's Jacob Shaw and I'm
really excited to talk

2
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:21,058
a about building adaptive aP's before we
get started though

3
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:25,156
I wanna tell you what we mean by
adaptive the first

4
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:30,025
let's go back in the beginning there
with the iPhone

5
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,660
one device one screen was pretty simple
to build applications for

6
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:38,105
but then when you consider rotation

7
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:41,860
now you have this portrait and landscape
orientations

8
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:44,144
and then after that we introduced the
iPad

9
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:48,044
as well as the iPhone 45

10
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:51,101
with its 4-inch display and I have all
these different

11
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,014
devices and all these different screen
sizes and it can seem intimidating

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,019
design aP's for well

13
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,598
and I with eight we wanna make it simple
for you to build a

14
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:06,000
to build one application that's both
universal

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,085
and is able to adapt taller these
different devices

16
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:13,120
screen sizes and orientations so today

17
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,056
I like to tell you about the new
concepts that we've added

18
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:20,079
for adaptivity inside you like it and
then

19
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:24,099
we'll take a look at some of the changes
we've made to both you controllers

20
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,548
and Interface Builder to support this
new adaptive world

21
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,340
alright the start of let's take a look

22
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:35,056
its size classes a new concept that
we've introduced

23
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:38,142
and I with eight in the past

24
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:43,047
used interface orientation and user
interface idiom

25
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:47,085
to differentiate between portrait and
landscape an iPhone and iPad

26
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:50,164
but Iowa State we're recommending
against using

27
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,153
these two concepts and instead were
advocating

28
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:59,099
this new concept the week off 55 balls
let me show I'll

29
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,268
show you a little bit about what we mean
by these differences

30
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,590
they represented by five class if you
think about

31
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:10,088
a typical iPad application and the
screens that it shows

32
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,780
you'll see features like split view
controllers form sheets

33
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:17,114
and popovers but really

34
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:22,613
none of these features are specific to
the iPad itself we're just using these

35
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,390
in this app in this iPad version of the
application we have because we have this

36
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,116
large horizontal campus

37
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:31,072
the display with them now on the other
hand

38
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:33,166
if you look at a typical iPhone
application you have a much more

39
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,087
constrained layout

40
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:39,096
where things are usually presented
fullscreen and shown in a single column

41
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,943
however this is also not intrinsically
tied to the fact that it's an iPhone

42
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,730
this just a tied to the fact that we
have this

43
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:51,075
smaller scores of appendicitis you'll
see the same kind of thing

44
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:54,134
and the master side us but you
controller

45
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:58,433
and even in the content a popover

46
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,430
and both movies on iPad so we call this
difference

47
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:08,132
regular and compact and we call this

48
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,522
access the horizontal side class now

49
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,220
if we consider the same kinda
distinctions in the vertical direction

50
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:19,034
you can see that on things like an iPad
or an

51
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:22,106
our night phone we have these taller
full-size bars

52
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:26,295
whereas in a more constrained vertical
situation

53
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,310
like an iPhone in landscape we have both
convinced bars

54
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:33,430
and now and I with aid we even hide the
status bar completely

55
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,090
and we call these also regular

56
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,022
and compact but this time in the
vertical

57
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:44,078
five-plus now you can think that these
two sides classes

58
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:47,082
in a similar way the way size works just
like a size

59
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:52,037
has a horizontal and vertical dimension
so does the size class

60
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,436
so if you put these two concepts
together

61
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,090
you get a two by two grid that defines

62
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,023
and you've the possibilities a regular
and compact

63
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:06,342
in both the horizontal and vertical
directions and you can have a view

64
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:06,624
controller

65
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,140
with any of these four possibilities
which results in different layouts

66
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:15,106
like it see here in addition to view
controllers having any of these

67
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,051
aside class combinations our devices
also have

68
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:23,077
default five passes that they'll that
they'll use an iPad

69
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:27,139
in both landscape and portrait will have
a regular size class and both horizontal

70
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,061
and vertical direction

71
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,126
an iPhone women portrait

72
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:36,095
will have a compact core sample size
class

73
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:40,100
and a regular vertical size class and
went to landscape

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,013
it will be compact in both the vertical
and horizontal

75
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:48,055
five passes so this is all a little
theoretical

76
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,137
let's take a look at a sample
application to see how this works in

77
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,041
practice

78
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:55,120
all right so the sample code that I'll
be showing you today

79
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:59,002
is available on the WWDC website

80
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:02,651
just go to the sample code section and
search for adaptive photos

81
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:06,923
the name of our sample app it's a basic
photo sharing application

82
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,590
and this is what it looks like on iphone
you can see our list

83
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,860
our contacts and I can tap on any of
these

84
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:18,124
to see the photos that they've set sent
back to me

85
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:23,433
if someone is only sent me a single
photo I'll go directly to that image

86
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:27,180
and if they sent me multiple photos I
get the list at the photos that they

87
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:28,023
sent me

88
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:33,075
and then view individual ones

89
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:36,138
now on the photo page you'll notice that
in addition to the picture

90
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,137
were also showing a comment overlay and
a reading control

91
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:45,074
let me write the photos that they sent
me

92
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:49,053
alright now when I rotate this
application to landscape

93
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:53,120
notice that are bars become condensed
and the status bar

94
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:57,014
disappears entirely

95
00:05:57,014 --> 00:06:00,038
this all happens automatically but in
our application

96
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,130
we've done a few more customizations
inside a photo view

97
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:07,010
when I wrote a the the

98
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:10,108
not comments will have a smaller margins
and the rain control

99
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:16,064
will shrink down to a smaller size

100
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:19,403
now our application is of course
universal

101
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:26,979
so let me run it and side at the iPad
simulator

102
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:33,655
here you notice that I have all the same
functionality

103
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,640
and all the same controls inside my
photo view

104
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,093
but watch when I rotate to landscape

105
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:43,119
all the bars have still have the full
height

106
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,101
and I love my controls here have shut
down miss it because we still have this

107
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,830
large vertical real estate

108
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,320
and in our application we're using the
vertical five class

109
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:56,074
instead of the interface orientation so
we get the right behavior

110
00:06:56,074 --> 00:07:00,081
on both iPhone and iPad

111
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:05,107
now one of the new features we batted an
eye with a is a resizable simulator

112
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:09,058
so if you notice here at the bottom I
can type in

113
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:16,058
new dimensions

114
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,620
and you'll see the my application has
resized and everything still looks great

115
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:24,088
because we're using auto layout insists
that standard system components

116
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:27,927
but in addition to just changing size I
can also change

117
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:33,300
the psych class and now

118
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:36,079
you'll see they were showing the iPhone
version of our application even on the

119
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:37,735
iPad

120
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:44,789
just by changing the side bus

121
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:48,493
so I highly recommend you test out your
application with the new

122
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:54,770
recital simulator and I with a

123
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:57,125
alright so now the you know how five
passes work in general

124
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:01,554
how do you actually get one at the site
classes in your application

125
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:05,818
what to do that use the new system we
call traits

126
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,262
traits are essentially properties that
you can use to determine how

127
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:16,116
the layout your application should
change at the environment changes

128
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:20,271
they consist a set a property's
including the horizontal and vertical

129
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,830
five classes that we just talked about

130
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:26,182
as well as the user interface idiom and
also the display scale

131
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,130
now all these traits a wrapped up inside
a container

132
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:34,062
we call I a tree collection this
includes

133
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:39,038
the trade properties and also their
values

134
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,841
and this new object is called you I
tried collection

135
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,550
you wanted the street collections you
just need to use a trade environment

136
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:51,078
train by Mansur our new protocol better
able

137
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:54,119
to return their current trick collection
and these include

138
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,104
screens Windows you controllers

139
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,099
and also views all these are able to
return

140
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:05,174
the current rate collection to you to
use to determine how your interface

141
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:08,110
should be laid out

142
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,042
one other object that's also a trade
environment is a you at presentation

143
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,057
controller

144
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,016
this is a new helper object that assists
with you control a presentation

145
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:21,149
and it's also able to park participate
and adaptivity

146
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:25,076
we don't have time to talk about today
about presentation controllers

147
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:28,076
but you can come back tomorrow at 11:30
to the

148
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:31,088
a look inside presentation controllers
talk to learn more

149
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:34,127
about how presentation controllers work
including how the

150
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:39,044
work with traits and adaptivity

151
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:44,102
now all these trained by romance make up
a hierarchy

152
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:49,046
and the trick elections that they have
will flow from parent to child

153
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,091
so by default the track elections at any
given child trig environment has

154
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:57,103
will be the ones that it inherited from
its parent all the way up to the screen

155
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:02,027
which makes up the route treatment

156
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:05,088
now in addition to getting the current
recollection from train varmint

157
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:09,151
they also have another method and that's
tree collection did change

158
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:13,066
this gets called whenever the traits
forgiven trade environment

159
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:16,107
are have just changed you can override
this

160
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:20,031
in your view controller or view subclass
snow

161
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,056
when you should be changing I love your
UI elements

162
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:28,056
that depend on traits and was even an
example that a little bit later

163
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:31,083
in our sample application

164
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,083
now let's take a look at a typical trade
collection

165
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,171
the street collection is one you might
see on an iPhone in portrait

166
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,140
we have a compact or sample size class a
regular vertical side class

167
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:46,065
idioma phone and at this point scale up
to

168
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:50,075
we call this a fully specified trade
collection because it has values for all

169
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:52,099
its straight properties

170
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:56,193
out of a possible have a tree collection
that's missing some up its values

171
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:00,135
and we call these missing values
unspecified

172
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,098
generally though when you ask the train
environment for trade collection

173
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:08,120
you go back a fully specified track
collection like the one on the left

174
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,025
however if a train by meant like a view
our view controller

175
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:15,051
is not inside the view hierarchy you
might get back

176
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:19,058
unspecified values like the track
collection on the road

177
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:22,071
you also get back these partially
specified take elections

178
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:25,138
if you create your own trick collection
using one of our creation methods

179
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:29,082
like trade collection with horizontal
five-plus which would allow you to

180
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:33,103
create a tree collection just like the
one on the right

181
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:37,056
now one operation that we can perform on
multiple trait collections

182
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:41,077
is comparing them to each other and
comparing a trick collection

183
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:46,081
involves asking if one tree collection
contains another one

184
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,124
now what this means about containment is
that for any trade

185
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:53,056
thats specified in the Fed second tree
collection

186
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:56,104
the value at that rate in the first
recollection has to have the same to

187
00:11:57,004 --> 00:12:00,097
has two match exactly so here the second
track collection

188
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:03,143
only has a specified or sample size
class

189
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:07,112
and this this horizontal side cuts are
equal so we'd say that the first rate

190
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:10,018
collection contains the second one

191
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:13,100
and the way you can ask this question
the up trick collections

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,044
is by using the contains traits Inc
Lexion method on you at recollection

193
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:22,055
if we were to change the for example
size bass at the second track election

194
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:23,113
to regular

195
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:27,088
you can see that now these two
horizontal size classes don't match

196
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:33,161
so second take: collection is no longer
contain by the first one

197
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,085
now you can perform these comparisons
yourself in your own code

198
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:41,096
to determine how you should lay out your
user view controllers

199
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:44,138
but you like it also uses this
internally for some

200
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:48,044
for some of its functionality and one
example of that

201
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:51,155
is the appearance proxy the Prince proxy
is a system

202
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:55,057
that we introduced a while ago for
customizing

203
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:59,148
the properties up your views and with
extended it and I was 8

204
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:03,090
to support recollections we now have a
new method

205
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:07,071
appearance for trait collection they
returned you a new appearance proxy

206
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:12,065
with a given trait collection that you
passed in any customization

207
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:15,070
the you perform on that appearance proxy
will only

208
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:19,069
take a fact on views better that

209
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:22,100
they conform to that take much in the
past in

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,069
so but you like it

211
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,132
general you pass it passed in a
partially specified track collection

212
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:34,061
like a horizontal 55 compact and then

213
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:38,085
you be able to customize all the reviews
when they're inside a compact or sample

214
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,170
size bus

215
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:44,070
this is really great for customizing
olive your views together

216
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,105
another class that we've added traipse
collection support to you I image

217
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:54,016
in the past you'd have a 1x and 2x
version view images

218
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:57,063
you generally put these in your image
catalog

219
00:13:57,063 --> 00:14:00,144
however and I would state we've expended
this to allow you to add multiple

220
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:02,071
versions I've your image

221
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:05,116
for different recollections so for
example

222
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:10,049
we could have this smaller image it's
used when we have a vertically compact

223
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,087
size class

224
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:14,132
and then the other image that we use and
any other time

225
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:19,081
for any other trade collections now when
you use one of these images

226
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:22,125
inside the UN ImageView the ImageView
automatically

227
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:26,107
pull out the right version of the image
for its current recollection

228
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:31,014
so for example if our ImageView has a
regular vertical side class

229
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:35,015
would be using this larger image and
what's really cool

230
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:38,019
is when are image view changes to have a
contact

231
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,022
vertical side class it'll automatically
update the image that's using

232
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:46,060
to be the smaller image and even change
its own intrinsic on 10 size

233
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:50,070
to shrink down to exactly match that
imagesize

234
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,112
and that makes it really easy for you to
use images that have different versions

235
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:56,039
for different recollections

236
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:01,111
and automatically get the right behavior
and wherever your application adaptive

237
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:05,106
and like I said this all happens
automatically with you I ImageView

238
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:09,025
we also have a new class called you a
image asset because you even more

239
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,124
control

240
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:14,120
an image asset wraps up all of these
different versions are the image

241
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:18,891
and it allows you to ask for specific
image matching a given trait collection

242
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:20,720
that you can pass in

243
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:23,691
and you can even add and remove your own
representations have an image

244
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,360
using other methods on image assets to
check out the UAE image at that

245
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:33,050
header file if the old BB the detail
that how this works

246
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:37,784
now one last thing that we can do with
trade collections is added together

247
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,370
we add one trick election to a second we
get

248
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:44,256
the combined trick collection and we can
do that

249
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:48,450
with the tree collection with traits
from collections method

250
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:51,045
anytime that one of the traits is
unspecified

251
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:54,048
in except for in one at the track
elections that we're adding

252
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:57,169
will get only the specified trade in the
final take collection

253
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:01,162
however if there are multiple versions
up multiple values for the trait that

254
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,106
are being added together

255
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,011
then the last recollection will be the
one that wins

256
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:11,067
so here reading compact to regular for
the horizontal size class

257
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:14,076
to or resulting trade collection also
have a regular for example 5

258
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:20,129
us and we'll see where this can be used
a little bit later in our talk

259
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:28,029
now the you know heart rights work but
the how we use them in our application

260
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:37,075
so let's run our application on the
iPhone again

261
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:45,805
and we'll take a look again at these two
views the change their appearance

262
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,500
when the vertical five passes change

263
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:57,005
the first one is a rating control and we
can look at the code for that right here

264
00:16:57,064 --> 00:17:02,069
although we're doing in this view it's
creating image issues

265
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:06,122
and sending images on them they were
pulling out are at the catalogue

266
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:11,025
there's actually no coding here at all
the deals with traits our site castles

267
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:15,054
instead we just have assets

268
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:18,301
that define and a regular version of the
image

269
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,350
and vertically compact version of the
image

270
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:25,754
in our Image you automatically updates
take this this resizing behavior

271
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,160
for ratings control and since we're
using auto layout

272
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:36,016
our entire control will shrink and
growth to match those images changing

273
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:40,119
notice that we also have black person
that these images here and returning

274
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,080
to be blue an application this is
because we've added

275
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:51,008
added image rendering mode support to
the at the catalogue

276
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:57,039
alright

277
00:17:57,057 --> 00:18:03,084
next let's take a look are over labia
here

278
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:06,119
in our in trendy content size method
we're looking at

279
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,608
the horizontal and vertical five spices
they were currently in

280
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:14,827
and using that to turn margins to add on
to our ancient the content size

281
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,276
this is how we automatically

282
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,700
change between this larger and smaller
margins as we rotate

283
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:24,056
between a vertically compact and regular
sized us

284
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,777
however we also need to tell the system

285
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:34,320
winwood when it needs to update this in
turn the content size and we do this

286
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:37,691
by overwriting track collection to
change here

287
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:41,074
we check if either the vertical or
horizontal size pot has changed

288
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,976
along with the street collection change
and if it has we just invalidate are

289
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,426
entering the content size

290
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,706
not all we have to do now

291
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:55,063
one last few in our application is this
profile view

292
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,302
the show some information about the
current user as well as the last image

293
00:18:59,509 --> 00:18:59,581
that sent

294
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:05,950
however when I rotate this landscape
you'll see that our layout changes

295
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,134
to show a side by side view and started
this

296
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:12,440
up and down D and wouldn't implemented
that by using

297
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:16,082
trade collections and five passes as
well if I go to my profile view

298
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:16,144
controller

299
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,413
you can see we have a method

300
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,856
that updates all OVR on allow
constraints and it takes

301
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,200
a tree collection that we passin checks
its vertical size class

302
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:31,151
and uses one set of constraints when its
compact

303
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:34,425
to show the side by side view and uses a
different set of constraints

304
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:40,124
otherwise show the up-and-down diem
alright

305
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:47,259
out the packets lied to them next thing
I like to tell you about

306
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:52,218
is some other details up our view
controllers have adapted the

307
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,700
adopted these concepts a traits and five
passes to automatically perform

308
00:19:57,007 --> 00:20:01,476
be more adapted in your applications one
of the few controller classes that has

309
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,175
changed most and I was 8

310
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,840
is US but you controller in the past

311
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:11,460
he often uses but you controller and the
iPad version of the application

312
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:14,695
and then you have to write a completely
different you control a hierarchy for

313
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:16,320
your iPhone application

314
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:19,321
when I was 8 we've made this but you
can't roller

315
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:23,320
available on both platforms you can just
write one view controller hierarchy

316
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:27,231
that works great iPhone and iPad and
that's what we've done in our sample

317
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:27,590
application

318
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:31,940
however we've even gone a little bit
further their

319
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:35,463
and forced this but you can't roller
have it side by side to call and you

320
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:39,366
an iPhone and landscape just like you
would have an iPad

321
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:44,882
let me show you exactly how we did that
let's first take a look

322
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,720
at the trade environment hierarchy that
our application has

323
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:52,891
when is on the iPad here you can see
that the slip you controller

324
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,558
is inheriting it straight collections
from its parents

325
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:59,940
and this gives it a regular core sample
size class

326
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:03,213
witness but you controller is in a
regular for example size class

327
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,064
it automatically will show the two
column view that you expect

328
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,638
on on iPad however if we now change

329
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:14,357
to our to what our iPhones trade
environment looks like

330
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:18,570
and landscape here you'll see that once
again this but you controller is it

331
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,566
inheriting it straight collections

332
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,095
but here it has a compact or sample size
bus

333
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:27,300
industry is it to show the one calling
the want to change this in our

334
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:27,931
application

335
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,470
will insert our own container view
controller as the parent at this but you

336
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:32,053
control over

337
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:37,846
then we use a new method and I was 8
called said overwrite rent collection

338
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:44,008
for childhood controller this allows us
to add our own tree collection

339
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:47,902
to the one that inherited by the child
the controller

340
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:51,976
in this case we'll be adding a regular
for sample size pots and a trick

341
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:52,462
question

342
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,460
and notice that it's partially specified
so when we add it together

343
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:59,585
with the inherited trait collection are
split the controller

344
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:03,088
will now have a regular for sample size
us in addition to whatever else

345
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,983
it inherits from its train bombings and
this regular sized glass

346
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,831
will cause it show the two-column but
the appearance

347
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,876
so what this ends up with when we rotate

348
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:21,148
from portrait to landscape is the wall
change from one to two columns

349
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,433
alright now we've seen how we can change
the trick questions

350
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:28,652
other charge controllers let's take a
look in detail

351
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,690
how the tree collection transition
occurs for example when we were kid

352
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,825
in this case would be rotating from
portrait to landscape let's take a look

353
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,210
at the time line

354
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:41,120
changes that occurs the first phase we
have

355
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,450
is the setup where we get ready to
perform this transition

356
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:49,024
then we show animations did indicate the
visual changes

357
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:52,450
and all that's done we do some clean-up

358
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:56,194
to fit to finalize the transition and I
was 8

359
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,674
winter went recollections change as part
of this transition we've given you some

360
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:00,420
call backs

361
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,068
that you can tie into to participate and
exchange

362
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:08,200
the first one is will transition to
trade collection with transition

363
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:09,667
coordinator

364
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:12,767
and this gets called at the very
beginning at the setup before the track

365
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,023
collection has changed to its new value:

366
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,107
you can use this to get ready for the
change that's about to occur

367
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:23,539
after that the tree collection change
itself happens

368
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:26,572
and immediately following that we call
tree collection did change

369
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:32,710
as I mentioned earlier you can use this
in view controllers are view subclasses

370
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,096
over that's not the end of the story we
still have these animation

371
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:38,895
and clean up status and you can actually
use the will transition to treat

372
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:39,836
collection method

373
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:44,594
the time to those as well transition
coordinator that you get past

374
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,179
in this method has an enemy alongside
method

375
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,184
the last few to add your own animation
box

376
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,235
to this transition they will get run
along with the transitions

377
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:57,925
own animations for example the rotation
in this case

378
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:01,858
there's also a way to add your own
completion box they will get run

379
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:07,483
inside the cleanup stage so let's take a
look at where we might use these two

380
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,605
specific call backs will transition to
treat collection

381
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:14,384
is great for animating you controller
changes along with the street collection

382
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:15,881
changes

383
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,133
so we use this in our application and
the profile view that we just saw

384
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:24,711
since we want this change to occur right
alongside that rotation transition

385
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:28,597
however will transition to trade
collection is only available on your

386
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,960
controllers

387
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:32,915
not on other trade environment like you
I views

388
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,810
and so tree collection did change is
great for use and you a view subclasses

389
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:42,153
where you want to update your UI as the
trade to changing

390
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,746
so we use this one in our comment
overlay view

391
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:48,951
the use our earlier

392
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:53,440
another we've seen the straight changes
let's drill in a little bit deeper

393
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:57,003
into the behavior that happens when its
purview controller collapses

394
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:04,399
from a two column to one column for you

395
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:08,940
as part of this change there too changes
that need to occur

396
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:11,146
the first thing that has to happen as we
need to find a new primary view

397
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:12,685
controller

398
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:16,105
to show in this collapsed bank on state

399
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,196
by default split view controller will
use the primary view controller

400
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:23,606
from your expanded to call on state as
the new primary controller and you

401
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,305
collapsed one calm state as well

402
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,447
however you can also change this by
overriding the spa beauty

403
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,280
controller delegate method primary view
controller for collapsing

404
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:38,649
but you controller this allows you to
return any view controller you want

405
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:41,700
to be the new primary controller and the
collapsed version abuse but the

406
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,192
controller

407
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:47,531
now want that new primary controller has
been chosen

408
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,992
the next step that has to happen is the
secondary to controller

409
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:54,800
has to get merged into that primary
controller

410
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:58,442
and in general but the controller will
try to automatically do the right thing

411
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,330
here as well

412
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,853
in fact in our sample application we
need to add any code

413
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,470
to get the behavior the you see here
where the secondary be controller

414
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,885
our photo view automatically gets pushed
onto the navigation controller stack

415
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:15,311
that we had from our primary view
controller

416
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,475
to generate you will have to do anything
here however there may be some special

417
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:19,690
cases

418
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:22,071
we want to interact a little bit with
this change

419
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:25,920
one example that from our sample
application is the No conversations like

420
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,612
that you

421
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,136
we show this whenever were in the to
call and you

422
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,565
and nothing has been flooded on the left
however

423
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:37,631
if we just use the default behavior this
but you controller

424
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:40,950
would take that secondary view
controller and push that

425
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:43,120
on top of our navigation stack but this

426
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,003
no conversation view doesn't really add
anything to the single

427
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:50,860
on the hook because there's no way that
the user can interact with it

428
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:54,210
to really we'd rather have a view the
looks like this

429
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:57,044
where we just show the top-level
ListView control or when we get

430
00:26:57,044 --> 00:26:59,503
collapsed

431
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,730
and it's possible to do that with
another split you control a delegate

432
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:02,146
method

433
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:06,825
collapse secondary to controller on the
primary controller

434
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,282
and I'll show in detail the code that we
used to do that in our sample app

435
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:13,742
a little bit later next let's look at
the

436
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,493
transition that happens in the opposite
direction we expand

437
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:23,417
from a single common view the to calm
the

438
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,123
once again their two stages the need to
occur

439
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,247
we need to find a new primary view
controller and by default

440
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,480
split view controller will also use the
primary view controller from the

441
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:35,077
collapsed view

442
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:38,720
an expanded view and once again you can
use

443
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:41,151
us but you control a delegate method to
change that behavior

444
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,810
this one is primary view controller for
expanding let you control or

445
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:49,974
now want that new primary view
controller has been chosen

446
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,940
we need to take the secondary the
controller and recreated

447
00:27:53,094 --> 00:27:56,148
from the primary controller there was
collapsed

448
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:00,667
and s but the controller will
automatically do the right thing here

449
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:04,101
as well eye-popping of our photo view

450
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,171
and showing that as the new secondary
view controller and our expanded view

451
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:12,730
however once again want to do something
a little bit special

452
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:16,096
for the no conversation you here if
we're showing the ListView

453
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:20,165
when work collapsed want to recreate
that no conversation flooded view

454
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:24,031
and make that appear as the new detail
view controller

455
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:27,130
on the right so we can do that

456
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:30,887
using other but you control a delegate
method separate secondary view

457
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:31,145
controller

458
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:34,748
from higher maybe controller

459
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:37,895
now adjustment on you that's the view
controller is doing all these merging

460
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:41,700
and I'm urging the secondary controller
automatically

461
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:44,906
and that's not entirely true the primary
control itself

462
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,614
is actually helping to do this merging
and I'm urging

463
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:52,690
and doing this using these two methods
on you I do controller

464
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:55,628
collapse secondary view controller first
but the controller and separate

465
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:57,265
secondary view controller

466
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:01,409
first but the controller these get
called by the split the controller

467
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:04,423
as part of its default implementation at
the collapsing

468
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:08,710
and I'm collapsing that occurs and %um
navigation controller

469
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:11,750
implement these to push and pop the
secondary be controller for you

470
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:15,391
automatically however you can also
simply

471
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:18,457
implement these and your own container
view controllers to get the same kind of

472
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:18,953
behavior

473
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,555
the navigation controller has or even
something completely custom

474
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:25,871
for your application

475
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:29,660
now one other change that we've made
house view controllers work and I with

476
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:30,185
eight

477
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,787
is in the way that you show view
controllers in the past

478
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,581
if he had a leak you controller like a
table view controller

479
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,793
and you showed a different one perhaps
by tapping on the cell

480
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,944
that new controller would reach up
through the view controller hierarchy

481
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,211
and grab the navigation controller that
it with embedded inside have

482
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:52,638
accomplished you controller on that but
this is a pretty tight coupling between

483
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:56,174
the leaf you controller an exact
environment that inside a

484
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:01,100
we want to try to move away from this
pattern and i with eight

485
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:05,745
could

486
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:10,440
so instead reintroducing to new method
that happy decouple this

487
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:13,623
showed you controller and show detail
view controller

488
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:17,230
these methods work by starting at the
Lee you controller

489
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,642
and walking up its parent PID controller
hierarchy until the fine

490
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:23,940
the right container view controller for
that specific action

491
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,834
so let me show you how the specific
methods work

492
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,513
we'll start with show view controller
and how it behaves

493
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:38,572
win it inside when it's called inside
the UN navigation controller

494
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:41,790
here it would just push on navigation
controller

495
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:44,977
so this is a great replacement for that
self-taught navigation controller push

496
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:45,853
me controller

497
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:50,609
approach the song earlier and what's
great about this method

498
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:53,635
at that it will actually adapt two
different view controller containers

499
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:56,922
and do something different for example
when you're inside this book you

500
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,492
controller and you call this method

501
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:03,700
it will instead show the new controller
on the left side

502
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:07,156
at this but the controller as the new
primary the controller

503
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:11,210
in fact even when you're not inside any
container view controller then implement

504
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:11,830
this method

505
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:15,025
will still give you on a Mac behavior
here

506
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:19,621
will show the view controller at the
mole you control a presentation

507
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:22,822
so you can always be guaranteed that the
view controller that you pass to show

508
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,119
you controller

509
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,960
will be shown and exactly the right way
for its current environment

510
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:33,685
next let's look at show detail view
controller this works similarly

511
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,610
and implemented by but you controller

512
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,165
here this but you can't roller will show
the view controller you pass

513
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,796
on the right and its but however

514
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:48,133
it that's the view controller is
collapsed as you might see an iPhone

515
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:49,560
application

516
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,842
been awhile actually redirect that show
detail view controller method

517
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:57,233
to show the controller and reset it to
its own primary view controller

518
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,080
let's look at a more concrete example
where we have a UN navigation controller

519
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,460
as the primary controller at this but
the controller

520
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:09,046
just like in our application here the
navigation controller

521
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:13,915
it's the showed you can call a method
and will push just like you saw earlier

522
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:17,333
so this show detail view controller
gives you great behavior and it's that

523
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:17,455
dick Taylor

524
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,440
whale show it on the right hand side if
it expanded

525
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:24,023
but it will push onto a navigation
controller that's your primary

526
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:25,190
controller

527
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:28,378
when it collapsed

528
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:32,556
and once again just like with show view
controller show detail view controller

529
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,624
will show that the controller as a model
presentation

530
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:40,950
if it's not inside any container view
controller that implemented

531
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:43,121
so these are those two you can talk
those two methods and what their method

532
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:45,350
signature looks like

533
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,593
but in addition to being able to call
them you can also implement these

534
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,177
and your own custom you control methods
and the but you get exactly the same

535
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:53,153
kind of behavior

536
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:57,710
as navigation controller and split view
controller get inside a mall at your

537
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:57,610
custom

538
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:05,249
view controllers

539
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,905
next I like tell you a little bit apart
how these methods are actually

540
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,347
implemented

541
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,663
not using a new method called target you
controller for action

542
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:20,275
sender this does all the work

543
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,606
going up the view controller Harkey
until the right you controller gets

544
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:24,394
found

545
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:28,252
for example if we call show you
controller would walk up

546
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:31,292
until we find the navigation controller
since that the first view controller

547
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,451
then implemented

548
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:35,856
or if we called show detail view
controller will keep walking up the view

549
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,157
controller hierarchy

550
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,718
and tell you after this but you
controller interview controller fraction

551
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:45,105
works by looking at the view controller
and see if it's overridden

552
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,462
the action method that you passed in and
also whether that the controller want to

553
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,818
receive that specific action

554
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:55,421
and the great thing about this is the
10th public you can use it

555
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:59,075
to make your own methods the work just
like show view controller and show

556
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:00,207
detail view controller

557
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,971
and we'll see a some specific examples
of this as we've used it in our sample

558
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:07,542
application

559
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:11,667
the last topic but I'd like to mention
is you control a presentation

560
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,750
and I with aid we made this adaptive as
well

561
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:17,474
so if you show a popover you control a
presentation well now

562
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:21,215
automatically adapt that to a full
screen presentation when you're in

563
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,814
of course %ah plea compact side us once
again

564
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:28,690
we don't have time to talk about that
today I highly encourage you to go to

565
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:30,548
the a look inside presentation
controllers talk

566
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:35,200
which is tomorrow at 11:30 the show you
all about how presentation controllers

567
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:35,791
work

568
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,030
and also hi can use them with traits and
adapted

569
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,472
alright let's look at the demo how all
those new controller

570
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:49,190
features work in our application

571
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,500
first look look at their profile you
getting let me show you

572
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:56,057
what transition looks like in slow
motion

573
00:34:57,002 --> 00:35:01,013
notice that our labels an ImageView are
moving right along with the rotation

574
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:01,067
transfer

575
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:04,069
transition

576
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:08,115
and as i indicated the way we do that is
by calling this

577
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:12,444
at the constraints for take collection
method inside

578
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:16,630
I will transition to treat collection
with transition coordinator

579
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:19,262
here we just use the animate alongside
transition method

580
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:24,230
at the transition coordinator call that
they constraints method

581
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:28,742
and then to make our view up they play
out

582
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:33,560
this will automatically cause this
layout these lab constraints to change

583
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:36,825
alongside that rotation transition

584
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:40,366
alright now let's look at how we can
override

585
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:43,716
the traits first but the controller to
automatically

586
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:46,900
get that landscape view that shows two
columns

587
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:49,958
will just add this fuel transition to
size method

588
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,873
and here if our with is larger than 320

589
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:58,170
14 add this a four straight collection

590
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:01,089
which is a whore has a horizontal site
that the regular this is one of those

591
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:03,018
partially specified track elections

592
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:06,822
that we talked about earlier

593
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:09,876
when we set that trick collection

594
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,140
will use the Set overwrite recollection
for child view controller method

595
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:16,370
to add it to our child view controller
which in this case is this but the

596
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:17,822
controller

597
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:25,569
now when I run the application again

598
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,015
you'll see we can rotate landscape

599
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:34,880
and get this took on the a

600
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:37,927
and everything just works an iPhone as
you expect

601
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,781
and landscape it works just as it would
on the iPad

602
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:50,140
now let's book in detail how we and
minute the collapsing expanding behavior

603
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:55,153
this happens nice but you control a
delegate method

604
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,281
first we had the collapse secondary view
controller on two primary controller

605
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:00,341
method

606
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:06,752
and here we want to use this from or
collapsing

607
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:10,049
and we're going from a No showing the no
conversation view

608
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:14,650
the hiding it and only showing this
top-level list

609
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,088
first well as the secondary view
controller if it contains a photo

610
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:21,169
and we did this by adding a category
method to you I view controller

611
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:26,154
to return whether or not any given view
controller shows a photo

612
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:30,073
and if we do not have any photo in our
current secondary controller

613
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:33,682
return yes this tells the the but you
controller

614
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:38,520
the we've handled the collapse ourselves
and turned off any of its default

615
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:38,751
behaviors

616
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:42,292
which would have pushed thats secondary
controller on top at the navigation

617
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:45,060
stack

618
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:48,415
we also have some logic here to make
sure that we don't push

619
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:52,250
a view controller on top venue
controllers that don't match its current

620
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:52,574
photo

621
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:55,920
you didn't look at the sample
application yourself

622
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:59,119
see exactly how this works finally we
return 0 here

623
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:03,021
when there was a photo and this tells us
but you can tell her that we didn't

624
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,068
implement the collapse

625
00:38:04,068 --> 00:38:09,121
and so will implement a wall perform
their behavior itself

626
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,044
and that's how we get the automatic
behavior a pushing this photo view

627
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:16,077
of the navigation stack

628
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:19,079
now if we look in the other direction
we're expanding

629
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,165
arse but the controller we'll take a
look

630
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:26,674
at all %uh view controllers that are on
top the navigation stack

631
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:31,440
and any of them contain a photo will
return L

632
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:34,079
this also indicates to this that you
controller that we

633
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,108
wanted to perform its default behavior
here

634
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:42,900
so if we had a photo and we are
expanding

635
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:45,084
the net photo would automatically get
popped off navigation stack

636
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:49,150
and shine on the right if we didn't
contain any photo though

637
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:53,614
want to create are empty view controller
and that's how we re show that no

638
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:55,160
conversation view

639
00:38:55,016 --> 00:39:00,025
when we're expanding

640
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,094
now let's take a look at how our
application moves between the

641
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:03,177
controllers

642
00:39:04,077 --> 00:39:07,163
first will get the conversation to
controller

643
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:11,302
this is the one shown here when one of
our conversations

644
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:14,917
has multiple photos

645
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:18,444
if we look at the method think it's
called when we slept a table view cell

646
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:23,310
we create our new controller in the car
show detail view controller

647
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:26,100
on that new controller the show that on
the right

648
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,042
and thus that the controller if we're
expanded

649
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:34,341
and other mention it will push it on to
navigation stack

650
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,773
if we're collapsed without us having to
write any device-specific checks

651
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:42,790
in our code

652
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,608
we can also look and our list view
controller which has similar but

653
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:48,770
slightly more complicated behavior

654
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:51,156
and that's so that we can show a single
view controller immediately

655
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,118
if there's only one photo or this
conversation view controller

656
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:59,207
if there's more than one here

657
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,391
we check if for any given bro we should
show that conversation view

658
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:07,130
and if we're showing that conversation
view we created and you show you

659
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:07,972
controller

660
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:11,420
this method on always push on so that
you can

661
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:14,131
onto with navigation controller even
warmer expanded

662
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:18,040
and the two call India

663
00:40:18,004 --> 00:40:21,039
on the other hand if we only have a
single photo will create that you

664
00:40:21,075 --> 00:40:21,694
controller

665
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:25,375
a car show detail view controller which
gives us the same behavior

666
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:31,058
as we had in the conversation the
controller case

667
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,920
now one more thing the on notice in our
application

668
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:37,096
is that when we rotate to transition
between a single

669
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:40,168
and two column view this disclosure
indicators

670
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:44,877
are hiding and appearing missus to
maintain

671
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:49,250
the behavior it whenever tapping on a
row would push

672
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:52,098
we show with the disclosure indicator
and whenever it wouldn't

673
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:55,107
we don't show the disclosure indicator
so in a single

674
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:59,127
single column collapse you we push on
all on all of these

675
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:03,876
rose been the expanded view we only push

676
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,810
on these multiple conversations views
and we did that

677
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:10,116
by infant by adding our own category

678
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:15,077
Tulu controller implements two new
methods

679
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:18,626
well showing view controller push with
senator and will show in detail the

680
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:21,190
controller push with senator

681
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:24,020
these correspond to the show view
controller and show detail view control

682
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:26,096
methods that we talked about earlier

683
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:29,114
and they just return whether calling one
of those methods would cause a push to

684
00:41:30,014 --> 00:41:30,056
occur

685
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:35,115
not which were used to determine whether
or not to show disclosure indicator

686
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:40,454
the way we implement the is is by using
the target view controller for action

687
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:41,920
method that we just talked about

688
00:41:41,092 --> 00:41:44,161
we passin the same action

689
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:49,001
will showing the controller push with
senator and then we get back a target

690
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:49,195
the controller

691
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:53,055
that implements that method once we have
our target be controller

692
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:56,866
we just need to ask it whether it will
push or not

693
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,690
and if we don't have a target quarter
now

694
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:04,070
then we just need to override those
methods and navigation controller

695
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,108
to return yes that showing a view
controller here

696
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:11,730
will always push and will override it
since but you can't roller

697
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:14,088
to return I'll since here showing a view
controller

698
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:18,089
will show it in the left-hand column as
I mentioned earlier

699
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:21,092
now the behavior for will show in detail
view controller push

700
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:25,908
is slightly more complicated because
here we need to check if we're claps

701
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,040
first

702
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:31,293
Jennifer collapsed then what take our
current primary be controller

703
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,690
and will redirect the will showing
detail view controller method

704
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:37,077
to will show you control her and this is
the same

705
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:40,626
kinda behavior that sleepy controller
implements with show detail view

706
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:43,413
controller

707
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:47,328
so we've seen how those are implemented
let's look at how we used it

708
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:51,980
in a table view controller classes

709
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:55,690
here when we're laying out wanna
parcells will call

710
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:58,093
will show in detail view controller push
and that's because

711
00:42:58,093 --> 00:43:00,166
the method that we would call when he
was tapped is show detail view

712
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:02,525
controller

713
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,127
will get back the result a whether or
not that action will push

714
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,670
and we said to set the accessory type:
either disclosure indicator

715
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:14,156
or none just how we get these

716
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:18,210
showing and hiding disclosure indicators
now

717
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:23,860
we also use I these methods to determine
whether or not to deflect a row

718
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:28,066
when it gets popped him and you can take
a look at the sample application

719
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:28,960
yourself

720
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:31,192
the fee that we have that works by using
the same will showing view controller

721
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:35,100
and will show in detail the controller
methods

722
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,339
the last thing I'd like to show you

723
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:43,170
is a new notification we had an Iowa
State you a view controller

724
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:46,094
show detail target did change
notification and this is important for

725
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:46,177
telling our

726
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:50,165
tableview when he needs to update its
disclosure abuse

727
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:54,094
this notification it's triggered by but
the controller whenever

728
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:58,143
the target they would have that would be
used for show detail view controller

729
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:00,400
changes

730
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:04,653
and this is when s but you controller
expands or collapses

731
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:08,052
so we use this notification

732
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,900
to go through all of our cells and
update their this their displeasure

733
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:12,138
indicators

734
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:16,380
that's all for our sample application
but I really encourage you to download

735
00:44:16,038 --> 00:44:16,115
it from the

736
00:44:17,015 --> 00:44:20,093
BBC website remember it's called
adaptive photos

737
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:26,012
and take a look at how and and plants
all these features

738
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:29,888
next I'd like to hang things over to
Tony the talk you

739
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,251
about some other changes we've made
Interface Builder for supporting

740
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:39,400
adaptivity

741
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:42,473
they take up high and Tony rich Rd

742
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:45,910
and I'm an engineer on the Interface
Builder team

743
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:49,030
Jacob just introduced a few new concepts
and I was a for developing adaptive you

744
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:50,400
eyes

745
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:53,103
such as size classes entry collections
now and show you guys a few new features

746
00:44:54,039 --> 00:45:00,138
without a tax code to help you work with
these concepts

747
00:45:01,038 --> 00:45:05,357
in Xcode 6 you can customize your layout
for multiple size classes

748
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:09,520
using a single interface builder
document means you can now target both

749
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:10,871
the iPhone and the iPad

750
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:14,390
with one story board or is it

751
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:18,890
you can deploy these documents backwards
to older versions via Wes

752
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:24,058
and you can preview your layout

753
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:27,908
for different devices Korean tations and
OS versions

754
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:34,250
all with an ex co now documents using
this feature will require Xcode six and

755
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:34,100
on a layout

756
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,759
so they won't be compatible with older
versions alexco let's head over tax code

757
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:44,803
and take a look

758
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,710
okay so here we have the storyboard for
an adventure game I've designed for the

759
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:48,940
iPad

760
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,616
today I want to extend the storyboard to
target the iPhone before get started let

761
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:56,955
me show you the app running in the
simulator

762
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:01,230
this is the main menu for my bench area
I love to have a few buttons that

763
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:03,892
control the content that shows up on the
right side

764
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:07,125
the play button takes you to this menu
for choosing your character which had to

765
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,407
be a warrior or image

766
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,891
the store button takes you to the store
page and the spine takes you to the

767
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,368
six-page

768
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:18,311
as you can see I've implemented issue I

769
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:23,910
using US what you control over here I
have my primary view controller with

770
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:25,190
those three buttons

771
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,016
Akira have my my

772
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,650
man character menu and down your I have
my

773
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:36,724
my store page in my settings page each
of these three buttons is connected to

774
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:40,314
one in the secondary view controllers
using airplay segue

775
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:43,835
i mean that that when you tap on those
buttons the secondary view controller is

776
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:45,093
going to your place

777
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:50,317
by the view controller that's connected
to that but

778
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:54,730
so as I mentioned today I want to enable
sigh I want to

779
00:46:54,073 --> 00:46:57,129
extend the storyboard start the iPhone
and to do that I'm going to enable size

780
00:46:58,029 --> 00:46:59,044
classes

781
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:02,065
I'm gonna head over to the file
inspector and check the you size classes

782
00:47:02,065 --> 00:47:03,514
box

783
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:07,660
when I do that I get this dialog telling
me that my document is going to be

784
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:08,102
upgraded

785
00:47:09,002 --> 00:47:13,081
upgrading will enable auto layout and it
will convert your segways to the new

786
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:15,121
adaptive segue types

787
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:18,340
if you do stores story boards before
you're familiar with the usual segue

788
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:19,558
types like push

789
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:23,842
mortal and replace that allow you to
display view controller when an event is

790
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,055
triggered

791
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:29,133
an expert 6 we've added some new Segway
types that correspond to the new queue

792
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:31,395
controller API to Jacob discussed
earlier

793
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:34,815
like show view controller and show
detail view controller

794
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:36,967
when you enable size classes why
medically upgrade your Segway so those

795
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:39,938
new types

796
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:44,774
so as you can see after enabled size
classes my view controller got resize to

797
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:45,093
this

798
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:49,940
480 by 480 square this way represent
sizes have any with

799
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:52,933
and any height so when you see the
square your edits were applied to

800
00:47:53,779 --> 00:47:57,871
to all onto all size classes unless you
override your layout for a specific size

801
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,290
class

802
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:04,067
in my case I've already designed my
layout to work well for the iPad

803
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:09,069
and now I want to override my layout for
the iPhone

804
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:12,125
today I'm going to use this button at
the bottom of the campus well

805
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:18,050
this button I allows me to choose which
size classes and editing for

806
00:48:18,005 --> 00:48:21,057
each of the squares in this three by
three grade represents a combination

807
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:24,821
oven with class and a high class

808
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,873
currently the middle square is selected
and Ike response to any with

809
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:32,194
in any heart when this were selected
you're editing your default layout

810
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:35,376
which is inherited by all the other
configurations

811
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,828
in the top left we have a square for
compact with in contact height

812
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:44,112
that corresponds to an iPhone in
landscape

813
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,347
in the bottom right we have a square for
regular with the regular height

814
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,650
which corresponds to an iPad

815
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:53,148
and in my case since I'm interested in
overriding my layout for an iPhone in

816
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:54,657
portrait

817
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:58,166
I'm going to head over to the bottom
left where I have a square for compact

818
00:48:58,859 --> 00:48:58,905
with

819
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:03,386
and regular act

820
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:08,000
when I choose that square I made you
control it grows in a row and tall

821
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,079
to show me that are now editing for
contact with in regular height

822
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,758
also you might have noticed this part
the bar the campus turns blue to show me

823
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:19,533
I'm no longer editing for the default
layout

824
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:24,133
as you can see in this configuration my
image view and my buttons are getting

825
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:25,640
clipped

826
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:29,253
so this is gonna require public Texas
first I want to give my image viewer

827
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:30,980
smaller image

828
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:33,194
to use when the with this compact and
second I want to change those buns to be

829
00:49:34,094 --> 00:49:36,003
stacked on top of each other vertically

830
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,876
rather than sitting side by side like
they are now

831
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:44,270
let's fix the image you first I'm gonna
head over to my ass a catalog using the

832
00:49:44,027 --> 00:49:44,706
jump are

833
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:48,013
and then ima select my logo image set

834
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:51,611
and over to the inspector and appear

835
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:56,250
for the with that review I'm going to
choose any and compact

836
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:59,046
that gives me a couple have new on slots
here

837
00:49:59,046 --> 00:50:02,285
the images that are put into the slots
are gonna be used at runtime instead of

838
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:03,290
my default

839
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:07,328
images whenever the with this compact
already have a couple images waiting

840
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,020
here in the Finder

841
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:12,021
so I'm just gonna drag those over

842
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:18,088
to add to the slots

843
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:22,257
okay nominee head back to the storyboard
and as you can see the image you has

844
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:26,102
been updated with a smaller image in its
no longer getting clipped

845
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:31,290
now sixties buttons I wanna start by
just selecting the buttons

846
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:34,958
so you can now take a look at their
constraints

847
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:38,440
for those of you who are unfamiliar with
auto layout and not gonna go into

848
00:50:38,044 --> 00:50:41,073
too much detail and layout constraints
for this demo

849
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:44,630
I recommend checking out our session
from last year's conference

850
00:50:44,063 --> 00:50:47,002
however I do want to point out that
there is a hidden view here between

851
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:48,940
these two buttons

852
00:50:48,094 --> 00:50:51,243
and that you exists only to hold
constraints

853
00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:55,420
it has a a couple constraints entering
in its container

854
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:58,054
and it has a few more constraints
pinning the buttons to it

855
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:01,091
the most importantly it has this with
constraint here

856
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:04,139
analyze me to control how far apart the
buttons are from each other

857
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,042
so fun ever want to move them farther
apart or closer together

858
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:11,808
I'll just leave it at that. with concern

859
00:51:12,429 --> 00:51:15,467
however now that I want these buns to be
laid out vertically

860
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:19,902
I no longer need this view or any of its
constraints all the buttons together

861
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:23,796
so that the next thing to do is clear
the constraints by using this menu at

862
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:25,358
the bottom of the campus

863
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:29,650
and is gonna choose clear constraints
gonna do that

864
00:51:29,065 --> 00:51:33,884
the the constraints disappear from the
campus

865
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:37,660
and you might wonder if that's gonna
cause my layout to stop working for the

866
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:38,104
iPad

867
00:51:39,004 --> 00:51:42,293
however since I'm currently editing for
compact with the regular height

868
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:45,405
my edits will only apply to that
configuration if we take a look at the

869
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:47,650
outline view

870
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:51,404
I you can see that those constraints are
still there and my document

871
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:57,380
they just been turned off for the
current editing mode

872
00:51:57,038 --> 00:52:01,017
ok it the next thing I do is remove this
view sense I no longer need it there to

873
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:01,455
hold the buttons

874
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:07,270
next to each other or is Ali so make
over to the attributes inspector

875
00:52:07,027 --> 00:52:11,076
and down here at the bottom we have this
on this check box it says and stop

876
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:15,374
installed means that the view is present
in the view hierarchy at runtime

877
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:18,954
as a sub you have its container I want
this you to be installed

878
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,730
in all configurations except for compact
with the regular height

879
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:26,562
so I'm going to addict I mean use as
possible in here

880
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:31,290
data customization for compact with and
regular height

881
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:35,970
when I do that I get a new install
checkbox and when I unchecked that box

882
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:39,373
the view disappears and if we take
another look at the

883
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:42,980
at the outlined you over here you can
see that it's once again still there my

884
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:49,098
document press has been turned off for
defending

885
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:53,435
okay now I'm just gonna drag around
these buttons so that they're going to

886
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:54,333
be

887
00:52:54,639 --> 00:53:01,639
laid out vertically I rather than
sitting side by side

888
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:05,880
okay then I'll select the buttons and
that label their and I'm gonna go back

889
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:09,420
to this menu in this time I'm gonna ask
Interface Builder to just give me some

890
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:12,129
suggested constraints for those views

891
00:53:13,029 --> 00:53:16,328
okay at this point I could hit the wrong
button

892
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:20,610
and try this out on the iPhone simulator
but instead what I'm gonna do is show

893
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:23,860
you how you can preview your layout
directly with an ex co

894
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,040
so I'm going to go to the top and I'm
gonna

895
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:32,473
open the assistant editor

896
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:37,190
them ease the jump are to go over to the
preview assistant

897
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:41,024
and since I'm interested in proving
previewing for the iPhone

898
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:45,158
for engine portrait I mean users plus
button and use iPhone 4 inch

899
00:53:46,058 --> 00:53:53,058
and there we go now I can see my layout
as it would appear on an iPhone portrait

900
00:53:56,038 --> 00:53:59,063
if I wanna try it on a landscape I can
use this button here at the bottom of

901
00:53:59,063 --> 00:54:00,962
the preview to rotate it

902
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,571
or if I wanna see both orientations at
the same time I can

903
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:08,400
use the plus button again to add another
preview

904
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:11,593
and now that lets me see both
orientations at once

905
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:15,830
as you can see in landscape the buttons
are are once again sitting out side by

906
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:15,160
side

907
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:19,565
and that's because we only changed our
layout for compact with the regular

908
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,940
height

909
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:25,143
an iPhone in landscape corresponds to
contact with contact height

910
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:29,600
and so those edits in the plot

911
00:54:29,006 --> 00:54:36,006
just in case you didn't believe me now
actually run this in a similar

912
00:54:40,017 --> 00:54:44,018
alright so I here we have my primary
view controller with those three buttons

913
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:48,146
as you can see it's now four screens
into running on a phone

914
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:51,400
when I tap the play button it takes me
to my character menu

915
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:54,066
and those buttons are are stacked
vertically just like we expected

916
00:54:55,002 --> 00:55:02,002
and when I rotate they moved to sit side
by side

917
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:08,310
let's recap always on the demo first we
used auto layout

918
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:12,580
his to design a flexible you I that
works well for multiple size classes

919
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:16,420
for example my ImageView used a
horizontal center in constraint

920
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:21,115
to visit to position itself for both
contact with and regular with

921
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:25,083
next I show you how you can override sub
using constraints

922
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:29,092
for specific size classes when you need
to I did this to give my buttons a

923
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,158
vertical layout for iPhones and portrait

924
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:36,150
at rather and a separate layout for all
other cases

925
00:55:37,005 --> 00:55:41,554
and finally I showed you a can preview
different devices and orientations OS

926
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:42,940
versions

927
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:48,177
even localizations all with an Xcode
using the preview assistant editor

928
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:53,081
today you saw a lot of new concepts for
developing adaptive UIs

929
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:56,700
Jacob introduce you to treat collections
in size classes which allow you to

930
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:58,464
modify your you why

931
00:55:58,779 --> 00:56:02,130
in response to changes in size

932
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:06,042
he also introduce a new API that allows
you to decouple child view controllers

933
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,075
from their containers

934
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:11,079
and to collapse and expand US what you
controllers

935
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:15,017
finally I show you some new features
we've added to Interface Builder in

936
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:17,236
Xcode 6

937
00:56:17,389 --> 00:56:21,210
if you'd like more information you can
contact our banja list sorry composed on

938
00:56:21,021 --> 00:56:23,030
the developer form

939
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:26,240
we recommend checking out the other view
controller related sessions from this

940
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:27,435
year's conference

941
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:31,150
and will also be having an interface
builder session later this afternoon in

942
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:32,084
this room

943
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:35,304
and with that thank you and I hope you
enjoy developing adaptive you eyes I was

944
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:36,094
a
