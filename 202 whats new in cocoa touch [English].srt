1
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:21,156
thanks so much for coming to what's new
in Cocoa Touch

2
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:25,079
it's really great to see a packed house
here today

3
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,086
I know that we have a lot of new
attendees in the house this week

4
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:34,055
and so for those of you who have never
been to a dub dub DC

5
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:37,060
have never been to a what's new in Cocoa
Touch talk

6
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:41,037
this is really a great opportunity for
you to get a taste for

7
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:44,189
all the new things that we're releasing
in the FTK this year

8
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:48,127
and as you know this is actually the
biggest

9
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:55,035
STK Relief simply FTK self for this BBC
is going to be absolutely huge

10
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:59,025
and recession is your opportunity to
gonna take

11
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,080
both technologies and I'll be pointing
throughout the session

12
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:05,073
and again at the end of the session to
all the other related

13
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:09,141
sessions to the technology so i'm
talking about. you can get an idea

14
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,049
have one other talk but you wanna see
this week not allowed

15
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:18,080
you're gonna wanna go to and that for a
fact so

16
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:21,017
to begin i wanna talk about this core
idea

17
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:25,048
what we've set up love what I West

18
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:30,014
aid is really all about from the after K
perspective and that this idea

19
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:35,089
at activity activity is going to pervade
everything that we do in Cocoa Touch

20
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:38,167
and Iowa State and adaptivity mean
several

21
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:44,111
think on one hand activity is a design
philosophy

22
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:48,077
it's a wave architecting your ass and
we're going to

23
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:51,080
give you an idea of how we want perhaps

24
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:56,417
to be built from now on using are a
design philosophy that encourages code

25
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:57,800
reuse

26
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,086
generic code that adapts from contact

27
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:07,100
to contact and is I able to go from
devices like iPhone and iPad

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,039
FEMA way additionally

29
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,260
activity income through the whole that
have

30
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:17,030
things that we are providing directly
from you like it

31
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:20,115
to you things like adaptive

32
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,480
view controllers adaptive you
controllers are something that

33
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:28,048
we have written with the design
philosophy of activity

34
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:32,050
that when you use in your app can allow
you to do things like

35
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:36,014
take a simple primary/secondary view
controller pattern

36
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:41,077
have it on iphone have the same code
that puts out on iphone

37
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:45,028
put an interface that you text back to
on iPad

38
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:48,047
and do that without any device check

39
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:52,088
now all be the same code running on both
devices will show you how to do that

40
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:56,156
them only we've taken the philosophy
ever activity to view controller

41
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:58,057
presentation

42
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:02,101
and we'll show you how to build code
that prevent something like a full

43
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,028
screen mode a view controller on iphone

44
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:08,091
and something more appropriate like a
popover

45
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:12,157
on iPad again without any device
specific tax because we're focusing on

46
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,066
reusable

47
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:17,068
adoptive code bad as the theme

48
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:22,154
a are Cocoa Touch on Iowa a additionally
we're gonna be pressuring

49
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:26,141
a new user interface icon fact that we
won all

50
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,092
application to adopt and that dynamic
erred

51
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:33,149
dynamic packed and adapting to dynamic
tax

52
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,111
this was actually a feature is
introduced in Iraq 7

53
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:41,013
users can change their preferred text
size

54
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,046
and I with 8 we've extended the idea
such that

55
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:50,050
all haps built in the Iraq respond to
dynamic type and are adapted to that

56
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:53,074
and we want to show you how you can do
that we recognize

57
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,116
that won the common places that uses
iraq attacks is actually

58
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:02,033
I inlet in a former table views so we

59
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:06,070
art took it upon ourselves to make it
you here to take a simple table like

60
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,036
what you with the impending

61
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,125
respond to the user's dynamic texturing

62
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:14,067
make the tax bigger and make the Rose
bigger as well

63
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,084
finally an activity

64
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:22,813
refers to the ability to this
opportunity actually to extend to the

65
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,575
system to adapt the system to your users
need

66
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,220
and desires by bringing your
functionality

67
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:33,871
in 250 maps as well other third-party
app suit on the keynote that we can do

68
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:34,610
things

69
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,700
like add a photo filter right within the
Photos app

70
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:42,262
without ever having to go to your
application so these are the kind of

71
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:42,870
things

72
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,131
that we're going to be talking about
throughout the talk the first part

73
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,260
is particularly about the design
philosophy

74
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,330
and then we'll move into lifting of a
lot of the things that are

75
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:59,122
especially knew about the API to me
again we'll talk about this design

76
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,770
philosophy

77
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:04,102
adaptive playout so

78
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:09,421
I said it before but of eight again make
the Kiev what we mean by adaptive layout

79
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,620
is

80
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:13,071
something that is reusable believe code
that is generic

81
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:17,171
that transcend device foundry and

82
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,656
orientation boundaries for the first
thing we want to talk about

83
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:24,825
is a simple idea a interface orientation

84
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:27,978
this has been a a stalwart concept

85
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,066
through the API since the s2k was
introduced

86
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:34,610
I'm actually want to move now to a place
where

87
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,137
when we're writing our apt our layout
code doesn't have to care what the

88
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:38,616
interface

89
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,840
orientation and that can be the FEMA
we're talking about now

90
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:47,053
so we can imagine that I designer gave
us a design for a photos out

91
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:50,817
and they say okay this Photos app

92
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,960
on portrait in an iPad looks like a grid

93
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:59,840
rectangular thumbnail photos and there's
five column from Agra

94
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:03,973
them only they give it back and say if
the iPad and landscape

95
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,735
show if the motor similar thumbnail but
seven columns up

96
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,930
now the nine-year way to approach this
would be

97
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:14,892
okay but hard code in five columns have
things

98
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,737
I for a portrait and seven columns and
things for landscape

99
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:24,546
but to become adaptive

100
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,150
we want to take a deeper understanding
I've why we have five columns in

101
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,654
portrait and why we have seven call and

102
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,490
and landscape it's pretty easy to
understand with the

103
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:38,448
this example but the reason is the
portrait view

104
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,894
if 768 points wide

105
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,034
and based on the thumbnail size that we
want to achieve it just so happens that

106
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:50,990
we can fit 5 across so we have five
columns

107
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:54,155
some only when we go to landscape we now
have 1024 point

108
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:58,094
in the west to mention and based on the

109
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:01,770
thumbnail 5 size that we wanted to
achieve we can outfit

110
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:06,006
seven columns the difference here is
that when we take that logic

111
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,735
that we say okay we can bit this many
columns in this space

112
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:15,100
as opposed to there are seven columns
and landscape

113
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,470
man the actual interface for annotation

114
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:23,596
is not irrelevant being in determining
what your layout look like anymore

115
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,933
all that matters is what the canvas 5
looks like

116
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,865
so there's also another decision being
made under the hood here if we decide to

117
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,694
focus in on this view

118
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:39,210
and that we've made these rectangular

119
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:43,190
not spread out from now but the Photos
app on the iPhone has actually much more

120
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,960
compacted

121
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:48,485
thumbnail other square in shape and the
reason about way on the iPhone

122
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:54,349
it's very similar vein reason it's
because the five the iPhone is different

123
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,402
and so we come packed the layout when we
are in a compacted

124
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,879
5 and so we can actually think about bad
decision that the the compacted iPhone

125
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,093
style layout which is what you see up
here the more spread out

126
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,864
rectangular from their way out as also
being determined by the five

127
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:17,014
and not actually based on a device
iPhone person iPad

128
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:21,149
tour now going to begin to think this
interface is determined by

129
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:24,203
the idea that it has regular size

130
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:28,765
to mention the height is regular the
whip his regular

131
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,890
and we're thinking about this
semantic-based fighting idea

132
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,187
as a new thing that we call five class

133
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:41,133
side coffins are a very simple a
numeration

134
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:45,042
that gets us thinking about canvas size
when we do layout

135
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:49,025
rather than interface orientation

136
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:54,111
I we have independent horizontal and
vertical 5 Proctor's and either wannabes

137
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:55,093
acted

138
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:58,098
can be either compaq or regular

139
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:02,105
am NOT simple choice can allow us to
choose between what we may now think

140
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,104
about an iPhone style interface

141
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:08,075
and iPad style interface really isn't
about the device

142
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:13,121
it's about the canvas 5 that we have and
will continue to talk about this idea

143
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:17,027
not throughout the fashion but part of
what makes back key

144
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:20,130
is that you may end up in a situation
where

145
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:24,082
you are showing something displaying
your view on them

146
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:28,107
iPad where the five the back canvas

147
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:32,082
actually compatible about just being on
an iPhone

148
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:35,086
and if you've written adaptive code that

149
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:39,095
simply uses the size rather than the
device to do it layout

150
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:43,141
you get and iPhone style layout when
appropriate in smaller spaces

151
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,068
on an iPad so the situation but we
cannot ban

152
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:51,113
are on the iPad having regular five and
regular with this is true in either

153
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:53,080
orientation

154
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:56,031
on the iPhone which becomes compacted

155
00:09:57,003 --> 00:10:00,034
and Matt you think that bit of
information the photos that can choose

156
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:03,061
to shrink to it more compacted square

157
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,134
thumbnail based layout them only when
the iPhone

158
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:10,132
goes to landscape it still has a compact
with but often takes on

159
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:15,035
a compact hype you can use both those
people information

160
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:19,108
25 what happened in your layout in your
app

161
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:23,084
so we've wrapped up this concept side
pockets

162
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:26,176
and are exposing it to you via nuclei in
your eye care

163
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:30,115
call you a tree collection you write
recollection

164
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:34,096
is a handy bringing together a few
pieces of information including the

165
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,167
horizontal 55

166
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:39,073
the vertical 5 choir the display scale

167
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:43,048
and user interface ATM now what makes

168
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:46,079
track collections convenient is there
Hong right

169
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,162
as a property on you a view controller
you can access them from your view

170
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:53,118
controller you can also get them from
the current screen

171
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:57,079
and then using that information you have
your side class

172
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,088
you can make that determination what is
the right thing to do for you

173
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:04,132
so the simple example we can think of
what we did with photos

174
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:08,050
and and implement i5 quad

175
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:11,037
did change map it and for photos

176
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:16,159
I it just means to consider what the new
psychoactive

177
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:20,074
an based on whether the horizontal five
clock

178
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:23,078
is compact or not the

179
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,129
the photos way out choose to use either
at compaq

180
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,102
squares based layout if it is a comeback
of course all five prop

181
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:37,049
or otherwise it uses it rectangle
rectangular from now more spread out

182
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:42,049
layout and then this is this particular
snippet model to be on a collection view

183
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,065
controller

184
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:46,124
so it just takes that layout object and
apply that to it

185
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:50,030
collection view as a new way out object

186
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,120
now thelma view maybe I'm not a thing
with I'm unfamiliar scribe to you on the

187
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:55,080
screen

188
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:59,099
I if this is your first time seeing
swept congratulations I

189
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:04,193
here is here your intro and you can feed
just how easy it is to understand

190
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:08,110
and this will give you 90 an idea of how
easy it is

191
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:12,069
to start adopting swept immediately with
all cocoa and Cocoa Touch

192
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,105
API's to it that I

193
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:19,020
all talk about quickly another new API
that we've

194
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:22,011
added to support your layout and I with
a

195
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,047
which is I margins so margin

196
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:30,096
coincide with an API release in Iraq
seven witches male pride

197
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:34,141
layout guide help you know about hard
lines on the screen in this case

198
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,087
the top and the bottom of the screen
where the top is a noting that the

199
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,149
navigation bar there

200
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:44,058
the layout guide tells you about that
navigation bar in case you like to avoid

201
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:44,147
a

202
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:48,058
if they were to a bar at the bottom the
screen your layout I would often turn

203
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:48,117
out

204
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:52,020
the top about to a bar in this case it
just a note the hard-line

205
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,053
that is the bottom of the screen but
there's another concept

206
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:59,081
in this year I that isn't covered by the
Arcade

207
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:03,119
that is the white space that is I in
cutting the content from the edge in the

208
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:04,101
screen

209
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,094
so and I with eight we're introducing an
API and Uribe you

210
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:11,106
which is male guide which tells you
about

211
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:15,029
that white space and allows you to that
whatever white space

212
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,065
you want for your lap that the property
annual review

213
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:22,082
also come native with native support for
auto layout

214
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:25,101
the map in the former knew an FBI
attributes including

215
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:29,067
lap right leading trailing

216
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:32,103
et cetera there's a bunch to the if
you've been using are allowed in your

217
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:34,031
code you'll find this

218
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:37,040
natural and familiar

219
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:41,021
so to learn more tricks about building I
adoptive where after there's going to be

220
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,115
a great talk tomorrow

221
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:48,049
on the mission call about building
adaptive ap with you I kept

222
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:51,050
summary moving onto talking about some
other

223
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:54,052
ways that we have adopted the philosophy

224
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:57,175
have adaptive five clock based design

225
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:01,082
to build things that you can use out of
the box

226
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:04,158
that are adaptive without you having to
do any work

227
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:08,136
and so we'll start by talking about
adaptive you control it is a great new

228
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,128
feature

229
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,033
and could begin to dive into the I'm
actually gonna go back and talk a little

230
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:14,167
bit more

231
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:18,083
about this idea fornication which

232
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,085
our rotation which we touched on with

233
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:25,054
the orientation segment of the talk so

234
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:28,120
now I'm gonna have a have after some
this question

235
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:33,011
what is rotation really because asking
ourselves that question

236
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,007
yield a result but helpless right
adaptive code

237
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:40,008
and that result is

238
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:43,080
it's just and animated change in for
five

239
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:47,034
view so if we consider a view

240
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:52,062
that on screen we might have been
thinking out

241
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:55,079
when the device rotate that view

242
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:00,145
rotates with it and this is a rotating
bill

243
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:04,046
that perspective actually complicate

244
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:07,080
the idea of what we have to do in our
way out

245
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:10,081
and so beginning I would say we're
encouraging you to take

246
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:14,115
a different perspective towards how
rotation works

247
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:19,041
which is just think a bit as a view that
happens to have

248
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,113
on this case a regular height in a
compact where

249
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:27,029
and when the device rotates something
happens to that view

250
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,111
and the thing that happens that view is
it undergoes an animated

251
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:35,049
5 change and perhaps it goes to a
compact high

252
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:39,049
and a regular wept I don't want to
confuse you

253
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:42,052
in that standard on an iPhone I

254
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,144
in landscape the weapons actually
compact but this is an illustrative

255
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:46,127
example

256
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:51,027
what might happen to reviewers review I
changes 5

257
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:54,082
Xing go to any new siphoning side cross
and that's really all that

258
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:57,150
happening when you're undergoing a
rotation

259
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:02,012
and part of the advantage over thinking
about rotations this way is merely a

260
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:06,065
5 change is that once you handle

261
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:11,100
rotations as size changes any other
situation that you might end up in

262
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,099
where your size change in you will have
handled

263
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,888
because you will have written your code
in a way that it can handle

264
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,290
size and especially the their animated

265
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,066
so in order to move in this new
direction we're taking a lot of API

266
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:31,072
that used to exist and iraq 710 still
exist and I was a

267
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:35,087
but we're deprecating this is just a
subset

268
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:42,087
the rotation API that is deprecated in
Iowa effect

269
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,047
and when I really like

270
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:51,776
is what we're replacing that's where
thinking about things as size changes

271
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,880
you can just implement one method will
transition 25

272
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:59,407
inference that pic to transition
coordinator

273
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,850
if this interesting things you want to
do if you wanna animate along with that

274
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:07,074
size change whether it be rotation or
anything else that changes the five

275
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,863
have your view controller you can use
that

276
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,490
transition coordinator to do an
animation and you defend in a block

277
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,488
with that transition coordinator and
those changes

278
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,933
will be animated along with besides
change which may be

279
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,362
a rotation have you can't or so in this
case I've used the side chains

280
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:29,980
to simply change the number of columns
in my photo layout

281
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:33,417
based on the new size so

282
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:37,375
beyond just view controllers themselves
I

283
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,760
with rotation we've built from view
controllers that

284
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:45,158
allow you to adapt the hierarchy from
device to device

285
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:49,063
in a way that makes it so that you write
Lasko

286
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:53,602
and for many viewers probably written
something like you see on the screen

287
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,150
area primary/secondary view controller
patterning you do that

288
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,023
using a split view controller and then
you in bed and navigation controller

289
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:06,077
as the master view controller that about

290
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:10,078
but you controller and then when you
would go and take the same design

291
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:12,149
pattern a primary/secondary view
controller

292
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,137
you end up on the iPhone with a
navigation controller

293
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:20,041
as you review controller and that meant
you would have

294
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:23,169
a device any Amtrak seeing am i on an
iPad

295
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,076
if so build this new controller
hierarchy if not

296
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,046
filled with other you can view
controller hierarchy with a navigation

297
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:32,125
controller

298
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:35,780
at the ritz I found while iPad

299
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:38,147
just as we want to make it for you no
longer need to care

300
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:43,126
what year interface orientation is we
also want to make it for you no longer

301
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:45,032
need to care what your interface

302
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:50,124
intimate anna & to do that we're making
so you can book this interface on iphone

303
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:54,069
with the split view controller as the
root view controller

304
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:57,124
and it will still contain a navigation
controller

305
00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:01,033
as its master view controller then

306
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:04,872
when you want to you know push another
view onto the stack

307
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,590
you can just call show you can't rely on
this it will do exactly what you would

308
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,125
expect from a navigation

309
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:13,063
experience pushing everyone to the back
and

310
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:16,085
when you would I execute something that
would be there

311
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:20,150
requirement to showing a detail on iPad
you can just call show detail view

312
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:21,094
controller

313
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:26,095
and on the phone it will do exactly what
you expect a phone interface to do

314
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:30,095
which is pressure onto the navigation
controller because

315
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:33,100
that are not available on the phone but
that

316
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,002
same that have a PI that same call
sequence

317
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:40,101
calling show view controller or and show
detail view controller

318
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:45,034
iPad were will yield what the user would
expect

319
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:48,053
on iPad which is a detail view
controller

320
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,442
over on the right its but you so

321
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,350
US but you can sure is really a
workhorse to be used an IRS

322
00:19:56,035 --> 00:20:00,104
8 the the key to is that it now
available on all devices

323
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,820
allowing you to build view controller
hierarchies that don't depend on what

324
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:06,086
device you're on it's the same hierarchy
and

325
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:11,026
iPad and iPhone and view controller will
adapt

326
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:15,087
for you so without it handles the
primary secondary controller

327
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:18,093
Palin transparently for you an offer to
go along with this

328
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:22,052
but you controller has a whole host

329
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:26,078
have new updates to it API and its
relief I can't even begin to talk about

330
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:29,176
what they are if you'd like to learn
more about them be a great talk

331
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:33,103
out tomorrow morning view controller
Hampton and I with 8

332
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:37,020
so moving on

333
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:42,016
to adaptive presentation this is another
way that the view controller system

334
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:46,093
is helping you have code that is simple

335
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:50,850
and device eggnog Dec but that does the
right thing

336
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:54,137
on each device we want to help you build
something like a full screen mode of

337
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,053
presentation

338
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:59,060
on iPhone and get something more
appropriate

339
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:02,073
like a form she on iPad or even a
popover

340
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:09,029
and do the with out Kodak shacks with
device Iran only the same code on every

341
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,073
device

342
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:14,098
so in particular for one thing that is
that is really

343
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:17,137
not changing the paradigm is poppers

344
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:22,089
Part II with a popovers were only
available on iPad

345
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:26,258
and we would use them in the form a view
i pop over controller

346
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,118
well that paradigm is changing
significantly because we're now no

347
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:35,330
longer requiring the use if you are pop
over control to present a popover

348
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:38,372
instead popovers are presented via API

349
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,110
as a presentation style

350
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:48,710
for view controller

351
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,120
so that means if you present a pop over
with her a view controller with the

352
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:53,941
popover presentation style

353
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,770
and the presenting view controller 5
we're gonna fuck off

354
00:21:57,077 --> 00:22:00,144
is regular it appears you expect a
popover

355
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:05,100
to appear with that same code using a
popover presentation style

356
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,025
if the presenting view controllers
compaq in the horizontal mention my QPR

357
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:10,119
iPhone

358
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,060
it would just appear as as in over

359
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:17,099
as an overshoot so that you get what you
would expect

360
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:21,112
on iPhone for taking their

361
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:25,074
these concepts and we're bringing an
activity to some another view controller

362
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,102
that we've and

363
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:31,049
like search results which may be
thinking of how to view controller while

364
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,071
perfecting that because US church
control display controller

365
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:37,085
is replaced by US troops controller

366
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:41,154
and US church controller is crucially
view controller some cry

367
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,990
and that means that it can take
advantage all of the power adapter

368
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:45,186
hierarchies

369
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:50,103
and presentations we've just talked
about that all at your fingertips with

370
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:51,086
the new

371
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:55,160
you I search controller as new USB
controllers also

372
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:59,065
able to be fully customized in the way

373
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,980
that it's you I appears and how it's
presented so that

374
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:06,120
you can adapt research controller into
your application here if you're a fully

375
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,461
customized you I

376
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:12,760
like that and FaceTime it will look the
way that you want to look

377
00:23:12,076 --> 00:23:15,119
we doing something similar with alert
and I was a

378
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,020
now we're taking you I learnt view new
action sheet

379
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:26,002
and replacing them with you i alert
controller

380
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:30,070
kinda thought you guys might like that
one I

381
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:33,726
you and your controllers also will do I
view controller subclass

382
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,518
but we can internally use all of the
power adapter presentation

383
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:43,200
to our advantage and to your advantage
things look great

384
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:46,005
of course you I alert controller adapted
styling

385
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:50,031
to the contact so that when you
presented on an iPhone

386
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:53,157
are in anything that has a compact
horizontal 55

387
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:58,062
you get an action she appearance you can
learn parents often the action suit

388
00:23:59,007 --> 00:23:59,078
style

389
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:02,171
you get something that looks like what
you expect an action sheet look like

390
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:07,074
and the same code the present that
action she on an iPhone

391
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:12,013
in a regular horizontal 5 profligate
I've had will appear in a popover

392
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:16,046
without you having to write any device
checking code

393
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:20,097
to you can learn more about how all this
adapter presentation missionary work

394
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:23,556
by checking out a look inside view
controllers Thursday morning in the

395
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,100
mission

396
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:29,040
I've been a stalker couple time it's
really great if you want to understand

397
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:32,055
the nitty-gritty behind how all these
presentation controllers work

398
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:36,598
and especially if you're thinking hey
this built-in you like it stock the

399
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:37,730
fantastic

400
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:40,082
I want to build my own presentation
controllers

401
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:44,134
that are also adaptive this talk will
teach you how to do that

402
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:50,075
so what we've been talking about for a
while as tools that were giving you

403
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:53,103
via the API to write adaptive code

404
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:57,086
but there's another steps to writing
great code

405
00:24:57,086 --> 00:25:01,115
and that testing so we're giving you
another great to all that we're excited

406
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:02,630
about

407
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:05,154
in the Iowa simulator and that if the
ability to

408
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:09,313
re 5 the physical simulated

409
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:15,470
hardware and so I don't know if you can
feel on the screen at a little small

410
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,095
but you'll find in your FBK p.m. found
it yet

411
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:21,179
Numancia the Iowa simulator their two
new devices

412
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,218
but you can flack wanted a resizable
iPad

413
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:29,700
and wanted the resizable iPhone you can
use the

414
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:33,366
to actually punchan custom values for
the hardware side

415
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:38,270
I've the iPad or the iPhone and pack the
ad activity

416
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:45,027
I've your code on the fly

417
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:50,231
really excited for how this kinda thing
can

418
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:54,880
make you can change the way we architect
perhaps because we can architect things

419
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:57,170
the way that we intend and then tapping
our intentions are doing

420
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:02,052
what we thought they were going to do so
I actually stole the top you see on

421
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:03,077
screen

422
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:07,486
from the a look inside presentation
controllers talk but I just mentioned

423
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:11,280
and it have a custom presentation
controller

424
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:15,062
which is the view that find out from the
right and designed to take up to 30 the

425
00:26:15,062 --> 00:26:15,123
screen

426
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:19,036
I went after that in the resizable iPad

427
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,124
to make sure that if it was in a compact
wet we do the right thing

428
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:26,079
and sure enough the guys who wrote this
are really great and it doesn't do the

429
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:26,147
right thing

430
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:33,048
presenter than over full screen
presentation in the compact with so

431
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:36,049
let's talk about some other new things
and I Iowa

432
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:40,063
aid for you I kept for customizing user
interface revenue clock

433
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:43,602
called you i'd visual look back view the
right view

434
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,530
some clock an interview that takes you I
visual effect

435
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:51,056
i'm Jack that parameterized custom
rendering mode for the view itself in

436
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:55,552
the contact and find it sewer shipping a
couple a different back

437
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:00,160
that you can use with the visual effect
view to get

438
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:07,016
the fact that you want and first one is
the UI blur a fact

439
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:14,129
believe me i've been waiting for you
guys to get view this

440
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:20,072
to for you I were facts will give you a
live blur over the content

441
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,101
where you use it the second the fact
that we're shipping

442
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:28,077
a review I fiber in fear back now
vibrancy a fact if you are

443
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:31,153
if you don't know what that is that
refers to the separators in

444
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:36,067
notification fenner a maybe a little bit
hard to see on the screen but you can

445
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,090
pull out your phone called on occasion
Turner

446
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,054
take a look at those beautiful color
changing color dodging separators

447
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,046
and that biven thing nothing

448
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:50,050
I heard a pop over there thanks and I
think that we're introducing

449
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:54,179
is image after image after to something
that encapsulate the one actor to act

450
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,087
the iPhone the iPad representation

451
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:02,098
view image in the home a trip there are
many comes with some API that makes it

452
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:02,927
really easy

453
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:08,380
to get the right images out of the image
catalog because we can you something

454
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:09,087
like image named

455
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:14,454
and add a parameter to it that take the
trick collection and sensed

456
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:17,270
recollections are hung right on your
view controllers

457
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:20,092
you can take that recollection from
South been viewed it appears something

458
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:24,129
and apply it directly to an ImageView in
your view controller and you have the

459
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,298
right

460
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,559
image the if statement that implied

461
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,800
in figuring out one-act to act iPhone
iPad Federer

462
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:34,015
is all encoded within the track
collection which you don't have to do

463
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,144
any work for comes directly

464
00:28:36,044 --> 00:28:39,061
with your view controller another

465
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:44,066
thank you another

466
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:48,215
you I feature as condensing bars you may
be familiar with the

467
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:52,300
if you've used Safari on Iowa 7

468
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:55,084
have similar concept when you scroll for
30 bargain this rink

469
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:59,095
well we've extended back contact
throughout the

470
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:04,324
IRS a fukn given you access to that sort
of behavior in your app

471
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,184
so if you have a navigation bar you can
make it that when the user scrolls

472
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,020
the navigation bar get a little bit
smaller or

473
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,071
if you have a view that has a navigation
bar and a toolbar

474
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:18,107
you can make up for it when you to
schools navigation by shrinking to buy

475
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,079
disappears

476
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:26,079
altogether third to learn all about some
great things you can do

477
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:32,112
with innovative customization I we have
a talk that is tomorrow

478
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:37,201
called creating custom Iowa user
interface so

479
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,620
I alluded to earlier to a feature that
is that we're pushing an Iowa

480
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:44,064
8 which is dynamic type everywhere all
about Paul

481
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,097
ap have adapted or have adopted ben-ami

482
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:51,112
type in our adapting to the changes that
are required for that

483
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:55,094
when I think that we realize is that
table views

484
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:58,161
are a very common place where cactus
displayed in something that we would

485
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:00,064
want to respond

486
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:03,147
to user tax I'd changes and so

487
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:07,055
we have maybe you here in Iowa 8

488
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,434
for you to respond to these types of
changes by allowing you to have dynamic

489
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:12,750
type rose

490
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:19,075
without actually implementing a delegate
method Table View High for our index

491
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:26,290
I know that a lot of you have been
asking for this over the years and so on

492
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,873
our solution about it

493
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:35,179
self coming caps like their sizing logic
inside themselves

494
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,044
they'd get better actually

495
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:42,142
because this fellow natively support

496
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:47,075
are only now so yeah have got to get
better

497
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:50,173
prep and serve you have constraints in
yourselves

498
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:55,091
you like it can derive the appropriate
height for those cells from the content

499
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,990
and I'm in a constrained to be placed on

500
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,420
you can do something like this where I'm
not implementing the delegate method

501
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,047
high protein extract and dad and myself
initializer

502
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:08,165
I felt from constraining and this
particular so I have attacked you know I

503
00:31:09,065 --> 00:31:13,069
hope some content I said a vertical
constraint that this ad from padding

504
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:17,095
around that text you using the visual
format language I do the same thing

505
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:20,324
on the horizontal axis adding padding on
the right and left

506
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,460
about TextView and then when it I was
created to be populated with an attack

507
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:30,114
the table you will know how wide it is
will be able to take the content that in

508
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,017
that text view

509
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:35,656
and the margins that I've setup without
a way out and determine what the

510
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,110
appropriate height for that fell should
be based on that contact and the weapon

511
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:41,038
the table if you

512
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,126
really I would like to learn more about
that or if you just like to hear me talk

513
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:49,101
come back to the same room two days from
now where I'll be presenting on with my

514
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:53,042
very him calling the beloved doctor
Libya good nest

515
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:56,124
and we'll be talking about what's new in
table and collection views

516
00:31:57,024 --> 00:32:02,038
to moving onto my favorite feature

517
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,467
a bio s FBK was actually kinda hard to
wait till this part of the presentation

518
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,420
but ap extension after extension

519
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:14,071
are just spent after goofiness in Aquino

520
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:18,112
after extension are just gonna change
the way that we write I'm

521
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:23,033
in the way that users enjoy we produce
for them

522
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:27,038
we can do things like in photos taking

523
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,136
taking a photo bringing up a sheet that
shows the extensions that we have

524
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,047
selecting York

525
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:36,094
pension right there in photos applying
something like a filter to that photo

526
00:32:36,094 --> 00:32:39,121
and ending up in photos where we always
were

527
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:45,059
we never had to leave the apt and your
content is right there

528
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:49,140
for the user at their fingertips you we
can also have sharing extensions which

529
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:50,067
allow

530
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:54,052
users to share to your sharing service

531
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:57,341
right from what ever after and they can
share photos videos

532
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,850
tax and other content without having to
do it or if you go over to your apt

533
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:05,097
has to be a better experience for the
user and it means more people

534
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:09,152
can share to your apt because it will be
left work for them to do so

535
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:14,071
we're we also have notification center
widget

536
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:18,126
you can write a fantastic notification
center widget I recommend up on my phone

537
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,035
and I can fear

538
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:23,057
every day I can be extremely grateful
for you

539
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:26,085
to you for doing that so I extension

540
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:30,180
opened a lot of doors some %uh the big
things and I are 8 that you can use

541
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,011
after sentence for

542
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:36,088
course photos sharing notification
fenner

543
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:41,080
it's also possible to build extension
for don't actually have you know

544
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:44,011
user interface and a great example of
this is the being translated

545
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:50,032
action without you I that we saw on the
key now additionally

546
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:54,088
you can build custom file providers this
is something that will allow the user

547
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:57,877
to use documents from your cloud storage
solution

548
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,080
EFI mostly as if those documents were
and I Cloud Drive

549
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:06,023
just by your extension providing them to
absent in the system

550
00:34:06,023 --> 00:34:10,152
additionally I what they make that
possible to write custom keyboard

551
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:14,580
be shared throughout the fifth time
front row like

552
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:17,099
back yeah a to learn more about building
after Fenton

553
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,133
we have two great talk today and
tomorrow the when you everything you

554
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:21,040
need to know

555
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:26,342
about building upon this just absolutely
tremendous technology that it's just

556
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:26,940
gonna

557
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:31,813
I i think is the fine posted different
from here on out some updates to

558
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,540
notification

559
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:38,393
notification changed a bit in particular
in the way that we model

560
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,934
I how users approve notification that
appear on screen

561
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:45,528
has always been true that users have to

562
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:50,210
approve push notification and

563
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:54,034
it one untrue previously that users
would have to approve

564
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:57,041
local notification to control local
notification I without the user

565
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:01,010
giving approval to not so when I was aid

566
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:04,015
any notification that shows your eye on
the screen is

567
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:07,035
going to require one time approval from
the user

568
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:11,082
the flip side to that as you can send
push notifications that

569
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:14,175
don't show you I to the user that simply
shuttle David here ap

570
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:18,084
and those will not by default require

571
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:22,097
user approval to you can just send
notifications the route from you don't

572
00:35:22,097 --> 00:35:22,185
have to

573
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:26,146
the referee about

574
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:30,093
notifications can now also have actions
associated with them

575
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:34,149
that is if you want to display something
I have the reply button or other actions

576
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,101
those can be tacked onto your
notifications and whatever action the

577
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:40,600
user solak

578
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:44,230
that will be shuffled over to your apt
for your custom logic to be invoked

579
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:48,045
based on action notifications can also
be location-based

580
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,099
in Iowa State so you can pop up a
notification when a user

581
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:54,108
enters or exits a significant area that
you wanna

582
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:02,008
show them in addition about

583
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:05,690
finally we've increased increased the
payload per side

584
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:10,118
from 250 hey 5 one

585
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:15,063
four-time from my love for everyone I

586
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:17,139
if you wanna learn more about this
there's a great talk with new highway

587
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,045
notification

588
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:23,046
tomorrow afternoon in help so we're
introducing a doc picker

589
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:26,080
and I would say and it looks beautiful

590
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:30,102
looks like that I as questionable on
iPad and iPhone

591
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:34,083
and what's great about this is we now
have 50 me why

592
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:37,179
for selecting document you no longer
have to write come

593
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,093
completely custom code starting from
scratch to give the user a document

594
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:43,114
picking experience

595
00:36:44,014 --> 00:36:47,063
if you want to be able to interact with
document in your application

596
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:50,117
you can use the UI document pick your
view controller as being exposed in a

597
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:52,081
course in to view controller

598
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:55,119
a good to take advantage of all the
adaptive presentation hierarchy

599
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:56,107
machinery

600
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:01,016
that we talked about earlier this
document picture has access to documents

601
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:02,236
in the local scope

602
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:07,060
and FEMA we also in the i five drives go
and finally

603
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:10,805
anybody who is supplying a document
right extension to the system

604
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,940
those documents were also appear in the
document picker

605
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:16,146
at all family completely seaman finney

606
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:20,107
for the user and your application just
get to you are all back

607
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,089
for the document any means to open to
learn more about

608
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:27,058
document picker support we've got a
great cock and building a doctrine based

609
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,400
app in the marina on Thursday

610
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:33,046
a quick word about STK modernization

611
00:37:33,082 --> 00:37:37,106
we made a few changes throughout the
headers I in the cocoa and Cocoa Touch

612
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:43,008
if you i've as want to give you a a
quick rundown of what that's all about

613
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:46,104
we've annotated all the designated
initializer have class with an A

614
00:37:47,004 --> 00:37:50,573
designated initializer annotation C you
know which ones are the designated

615
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:52,000
initializer

616
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,093
which of course you need to know if
you're going to be a good for crop

617
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:55,152
improvement

618
00:37:56,052 --> 00:38:01,371
additionally I love the return types
furnish litres have changed from ID to

619
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,040
instance tight

620
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:09,008
kinda makes over auto complete better I

621
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:12,693
and we've introduced additional
properties I in place a classic ok a

622
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,190
method

623
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:17,107
in particular like the NFL object
protocol where hash used to be a method

624
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:21,306
ash is now a property for Anna object

625
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:26,420
and these changes enhance the experience
for use with the cocoa and Cocoa Touch

626
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,135
API token object if the and in
particularly

627
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:33,051
with swept so hand-off

628
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:36,125
is an opportunity for your out to

629
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,108
participate in a feature that we talked
about in the Keno

630
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:44,037
which is continuity

631
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:47,830
continuity is the thing that allows

632
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:52,122
users to do something like start a email
on their phone

633
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:56,041
go to their computer finish that email

634
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:59,055
and it all seems experience well

635
00:38:59,055 --> 00:39:02,056
with hand of we're giving you the
opportunity to

636
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:05,104
have user active you have your own so
that they can do that

637
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:09,004
not just with male or with other
built-in

638
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:13,008
activity but with your activities as
well

639
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:16,075
so hand-off has built-in support for
activities

640
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:21,106
in apk it and do I care both natively
support activities in their document

641
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,035
factors

642
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:27,510
and I you'll be able to use that

643
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:30,900
out of the box to learn more about
hand-off a check out the adopting

644
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,470
handoff and Iowa

645
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:35,112
talk tomorrow in the mission so

646
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:39,066
there's a whole lot of stuff has changed
here

647
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:42,130
I lots of new things we also have

648
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:46,040
several brand new frameworks an Iowa

649
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:51,090
8 and I don't really have time to talk
in any kinda depth about these things

650
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:54,085
but I want to give you an idea hey
avoided out there

651
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:58,131
so you can see what other sessions that
you'd like to attend because

652
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:02,580
this framework allow you to build after
you simply could not build

653
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,870
before iraq 8 and that's fantastic

654
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:08,179
of course first one we've already
touched on Notification Center

655
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,115
will support you building extension to
add widgets to

656
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:17,099
the notifications on iraq's that
notification ended up from work

657
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,218
and you can learn about that by I
checking out

658
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,600
the building up its pensions talk

659
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:27,077
of a brand-new photos framework this
will give you

660
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:32,075
complete read/write access to the photos
library

661
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:35,132
this means you can do whenever your
application needs to do

662
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:40,069
to provide the best user experience
possible taken to leave for

663
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:43,142
I can do non-destructive at do whatever
it needs to do

664
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:47,043
so that the user gets what they need

665
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:50,952
while mister actually in the photos talk

666
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:55,170
her in in the photos framework I do want
to take this opportunity to play now

667
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:58,052
II with a also brings custom core image
filters

668
00:40:58,052 --> 00:41:02,064
and so you'll be able to use these on
your photos as well as videos and Iowa

669
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:08,133
State

670
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,041
for brand new framework called cloud
kept and this framework

671
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:17,019
is absolutely spectacular I really can't
say enough good things about it

672
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:21,062
I'm it gives you more control than you
ever had over the data that you put

673
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:25,081
in the cloud and more really makes this

674
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:28,106
spectacular is you can use cloud care to
build

675
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:32,765
a client-server application with a
building a server side

676
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:36,970
you can to find that on the client side
and what Apple take care

677
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:40,966
for you so I and II can even wait to see
what startups come

678
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,370
out a bit will be fantastic and we love
cloud kit

679
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:49,120
so much that we build I hard drive and
photos in the cloud on top of it

680
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:54,081
it's a fantastic technology and you love
building your up some top

681
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:57,141
not a new framework if health care
health kit

682
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:02,108
brings all of the biometric information
from the various devices the user has

683
00:42:03,008 --> 00:42:06,090
all into one place this information is
shared across

684
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:09,050
aP's rather than filo dough into one app
has

685
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:14,062
one biometric device information another
Apple has another biometric devices

686
00:42:14,062 --> 00:42:14,156
information

687
00:42:15,056 --> 00:42:19,079
at 4shared so you can I use that to
create

688
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,087
a perfect experience for user based on
all in the biometric data available

689
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:27,148
from all of their customers family

690
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:32,066
we are introducing a home-care which
does the same thing for connected home

691
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:32,148
devices

692
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:36,072
put all about information in one play

693
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:39,154
to rate you can build an app for that
everything the user needs

694
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:43,127
for their connected home accessing all
of those things

695
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:47,114
in one place of have a new local
authentication

696
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:51,083
framework this allows you to leverage
the power

697
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:54,117
biometric authentication in your own apt

698
00:42:55,017 --> 00:42:58,186
and as you probably know from having
watched the keynote this means that you

699
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,040
get to use patch id:

700
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:03,009
right inside your application that's
great and we have a talk that you can go

701
00:43:03,054 --> 00:43:03,063
check out

702
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:07,122
I to learn more about how to do that
Russia bringing

703
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:11,098
been kept to iraq 8 think editor

704
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:15,152
great framework for building 3d
rendering and we've had it on the Mac

705
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:16,135
for a year

706
00:43:17,035 --> 00:43:21,042
when i bringing it to Iraq now we have a
great cross-platform solution

707
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:24,113
for doing 3d rendering view have our do
you think a

708
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:29,097
you're gonna love this so there you have
it your offer gonna love it

709
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:33,102
everybody's gonna love it threat that
all the brand new frameworks that not

710
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:35,078
all the changes though

711
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:38,086
a point out one other framework that is
made some significant changes which is

712
00:43:39,058 --> 00:43:40,094
core location

713
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:43,128
crew location now make that possible to
get

714
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:47,114
the user's location details indoors and
by that I mean

715
00:43:48,014 --> 00:43:51,055
you can get what Florida users on not
just

716
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:57,119
where they are

717
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:01,044
regrettable after you have never never
built before

718
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:06,049
I'm for I we also have new EP I think
rotation that will make it

719
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:10,898
easier to save power when getting
significant location updates how to be a

720
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:14,790
better for everyone I'm a big power
magnet myself

721
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,115
for using me is on hand everyone's
experience that were also changing

722
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:22,037
the user approval model around
provocation

723
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:25,043
so that users can now are choose to
prove your app

724
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:28,153
either all the time for a location near
or only give a

725
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:32,069
you can you can this request to be
approved only when you're in you

726
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:35,156
so the user can rest assured that your
app is not using

727
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:39,130
location not draining the battery not
feeling any secret

728
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:45,066
when your apt if not in use for to
change provocation

729
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:49,152
so to finish up here want to reiterate

730
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:54,121
some ideas about the design philosophy
because really I O FA

731
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:58,550
is a is a mark in the fan for how we
think about

732
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:02,114
building apt in addition to all a bit
new API

733
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:07,463
so we're going to be centered around
building reusable code that device

734
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:08,750
taking off stick

735
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:11,100
that is air face orientation agnostic
that is

736
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,074
adaptive so we can use the tools that
are presented in you like it and I with

737
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:16,119
a

738
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:21,050
to them for fire layout by using things
like five profits or not

739
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:24,020
worrying about what the specific 5
things are

740
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:27,160
we use the five clock to make a
determination whether it's compact

741
00:45:28,006 --> 00:45:33,042
a regular and we can't ask for things
out using the resizable familiar

742
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:38,192
we can use I the iPhone and iPad code in
a unified way

743
00:45:39,092 --> 00:45:42,099
but we only have one bit of code that
does the right thing

744
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:46,103
on all devices and we're bringing a
doctor view controller technology to you

745
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,071
that will allow you to do that you can
integrate into the system now using

746
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:52,098
after extension

747
00:45:52,098 --> 00:45:56,102
so that the user can do more things in
more places than ever before

748
00:45:57,038 --> 00:46:00,122
and your ass can be more useful for and
that ever done

749
00:46:01,022 --> 00:46:04,117
am finally have we just covered since
we've introduced

750
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:08,050
several brand new framework for things
that you just could never do before that

751
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:09,027
now you can do

752
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:12,116
you can expand your tool set using all
of these

753
00:46:13,016 --> 00:46:17,097
brand new thing so if you want more
information about anything in this

754
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:20,446
talk you can always talk to are
innumerable

755
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:26,040
frameworks evangelist Jack Barron check
out our documentation on developer Apple

756
00:46:26,004 --> 00:46:30,025
com or head up the dough forms for
people like me can answer your questions

757
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:35,048
I have a whole bunch related fashion you
can check out or get out of the way

758
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:38,637
I don't wanna right any block anyone
from running the down is actually

759
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:40,074
another screen

760
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:43,623
after this for anyone who wants a check
out more

761
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:48,120
related fashion something too many
people using pencil

762
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:51,040
is that a national related fashion

763
