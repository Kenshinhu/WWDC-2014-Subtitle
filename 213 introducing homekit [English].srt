1
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:20,029
hello everybody in

2
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:23,048
thank you very much for my name is Kevin
McLaughlin

3
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:26,257
and I am here this afternoon to tell you
about home kit

4
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:31,220
you know it's been a day packed full of
all kinds of new information that I hope

5
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:34,631
you're very excited to be here as I am
excited to see everybody here

6
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,540
so he heard a little bit about home kit
already

7
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:44,111
I assume in let's talk about it just as
we're getting started here

8
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:50,023
so home kid is a new feature for I O S

9
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:53,086
that is bringing

10
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,675
has Craig said very well some
rationality

11
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,523
to home automation it provides a great
opportunity for us

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,390
you as developers must work together

13
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:11,948
to provide a much more consistent
experience for our users

14
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,680
as they start to get into home
automation and we want to bring this to

15
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:17,117
a much wider

16
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:24,028
audience then home automation has really
been accessible to in the past

17
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:28,031
so let's get started so today

18
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:31,062
I will tell you a little bit about the
features a home kit

19
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:35,171
and we'll go through the core concepts
how to use the API

20
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,120
how to get started and a few advanced
topics

21
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:43,043
that are either interesting to be and
hopefully to you or I know are

22
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:43,138
interesting to you

23
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:49,093
so it's good on with it to the first
feature want to tell you about

24
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:53,142
is something that is really important
and a score to delivering

25
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,860
the consistency they talked about

26
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:01,138
so we have a common database that is
stored in Iowa

27
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,103
and it contains all of the home
information

28
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,492
all the accessory information that has
been configured

29
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,080
and is available to Olive your caps

30
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:18,056
every time a user uses one of your abs

31
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:22,061
to configure a new accessory to set up
their home to set up some other

32
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,015
operation

33
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,540
those things are stored through home kit

34
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:30,062
through the framework in this common
database and then when the user uses

35
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,113
another application

36
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:37,017
for some other purpose and they see some
of their home information

37
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:40,062
in this other applications gonna see the
same information that they saw

38
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:44,069
or that they set up in there other
applications miss mean

39
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,161
to our users to your users everything is
going to look

40
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:53,119
a lot more connected it to make a lot
more sense this is starting to provide

41
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,428
that consistent experience everyone we
want to deliver

42
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,330
now building on that

43
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:06,109
as we mentioned yesterday we have a
great

44
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,077
interface for users which is period

45
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:14,125
to users can use Siri

46
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,027
to interact with their home kit
accessories

47
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:22,914
in a very natural way I just speaking
commands that make sense

48
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,270
I talk a little bit about how that
enabled as we go through the

49
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:27,075
presentation today

50
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:30,140
now in

51
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:34,020
creating home kit we have

52
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:37,955
put in a lot of effort to define a

53
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,230
common language for us to use to talk to
accessories

54
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:47,058
but we can't define

55
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:50,059
every kinda accessory that

56
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,164
all are clever accessory manufacturers
are going to invent

57
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:57,141
have already heard about dozens of
interesting things

58
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,108
that are well beyond

59
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,095
what we're starting to you can see here
garage door light bulbs or like these

60
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:07,192
are things that are common accessory

61
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:12,156
that we have defined in home cannot talk
about some more about as well anything

62
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,120
else is possible

63
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:18,054
we don't want home kit to be

64
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:22,074
restricted in contained we want home kit
to create

65
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:25,153
innovation in creativity and so

66
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:31,150
anything that an accessory manufacturer
can imagine and can create

67
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,009
they can define and make available

68
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:41,081
through home kit to your applications

69
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,087
all that exciting

70
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,125
you want to be able to use these
accessories

71
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:53,099
and so home kit also

72
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:59,165
provides access to your home kit
accessories when you are not at home

73
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:03,103
this is enabled through i OS device
connectivity

74
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:08,006
and there's no special requirement for
your application

75
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:13,012
or for the accessories to take advantage
of this great feature on K

76
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:16,071
but with all that connectivity

77
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,745
come something very important actually a
pair of things that'll

78
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:24,800
very closely coupled that security and
privacy

79
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:27,062
we take security and privacy very
seriously

80
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:32,091
we have spent a lot of time and effort
attention reviews after reviews making

81
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:34,124
sure that we have a great solution here

82
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:41,047
so we have end-to-end encryption between
i OS devices & accessories

83
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:46,072
and this enables us to have

84
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:50,491
security so that accessories can be
misused

85
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,410
it also enables us to ensure user
privacy is maintained

86
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:59,055
we don't think that it's good enough to
be sorted

87
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:04,055
private your data stored somewhere else

88
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:07,093
we think it's important to be take
privacy very security

89
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:12,137
yes seriously and do the best as
possible

90
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:16,132
in keeping with this paradigm of
insuring

91
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:21,056
privacy and security and making sure
that our users have really good reliable

92
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:27,195
understandable experiences when they
start using your home kit applications

93
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,910
home papi can only be used when your
application is in the foreground

94
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,128
this ensures that users know exactly
what's going on there's nothing for them

95
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,056
to be afraid out when they take that
first step

96
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:41,141
or second step into using home
automation

97
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:46,020
okay that's enough about the high level
stuff

98
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,442
let's get into some other details so

99
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,400
to get started with home kit your entry
point

100
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:58,025
is the home manager

101
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:03,087
the Home Manager provides your pointers
to the common database

102
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:06,090
accessed through the home's the Home
Manager

103
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,088
allows your application to manage the
homes

104
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,136
which one is primary adding or removing
homes

105
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:18,093
as necessary and we'll notify you of
changes

106
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:21,093
now for examples somebody might have

107
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:24,452
for whatever reason multiple home set up
those may change this is where you get

108
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,210
notified about us you can start updating
your application

109
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:31,105
to match with the user knows they have

110
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:36,037
to the home managers represented by the
HM Home Manager class

111
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:40,060
you simply created instance I love it
and then you said

112
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:44,945
a delegate to be your application

113
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,830
to use the Home Manager

114
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,091
the most important thing the first thing
you want to do is you want to implement

115
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:51,110
this

116
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:56,059
delegate call back Home Manager did
update homes

117
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:59,367
when you get this call back that means
that

118
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,010
the whole manager has finished loading
are preparing the home data

119
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,210
and you can now save a pointer to the
rave homes

120
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,030
you can also save what is currently set
is the primary home

121
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:17,087
now if there aren't any homes

122
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:21,146
then you need to create a home for the
user to add a home with name

123
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:25,134
and that completes with a

124
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:29,173
completion handler would only fail
likely if the

125
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,533
home had the same name as another home

126
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,043
because homes

127
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:39,337
need to be uniquely named so homes
contain

128
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,092
all the data for a home so you have your
rooms have your accessories and so on

129
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:48,810
notifies you changes to that home

130
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:51,160
and the names have homes are recognized
by series so that users can refer to

131
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:52,485
them

132
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:57,110
when they're giving commands

133
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,431
on a home we have the name

134
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,871
we have an array of all the rooms an
array of all the accessories that are in

135
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:08,501
that home

136
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,185
to fill out the concept a date the
imager the

137
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:16,542
the map a home in every wanna call it me
to create rooms

138
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,842
so on the home you can create a room

139
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,907
are at a room with name provider a name
for the room

140
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:27,160
and again that would only fail typically
if there was a room that already have

141
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,845
the same name

142
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:36,014
so moving on two rooms rooms contain
accessories

143
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:39,244
room again we'll notify you of changes
and

144
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:43,744
rooms must be uniquely named with in a
home

145
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,241
solo homer created own namespace

146
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:51,466
everything within a home must have a
unique name

147
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,722
names have rooms are recognized by Siri
users can also interact with them to

148
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,040
maximize natural

149
00:09:57,004 --> 00:10:01,553
interactions with their accessories
rooms are represented by the HM room

150
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,590
class

151
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:08,704
and they have an array the accessories
that are in that room

152
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,844
let's move onto accessories so

153
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:15,600
accessory corresponds to a physical
device

154
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:18,595
accessories are assigned to ruminate
that can change you can assign an

155
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,192
accessory to a different room

156
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:24,493
accessory objects allow you to access
the device

157
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,903
state can I talk to the success three
right now for example

158
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,121
will notify you of changes to that
accessory again they have to be uniquely

159
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,007
named within home

160
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:42,553
and names and accessories also are
recognized by Siri

161
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,844
an accessory is

162
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,591
the whole object that the user is
referring to

163
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:55,160
not talk about how the details that
accessory

164
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:58,755
are exposed to made available after this

165
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,955
so an accessory has a pointer back to
the room that im

166
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,720
and it has appointed to the rave
services

167
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:11,111
that represent the functionality of that
accessory good

168
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,230
important Delhi a call back for you to
implement an accessory is the did update

169
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:20,342
reachability call back so

170
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:24,170
an accessory at any point in time may be
reachable you may be able to communicate

171
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:24,091
with it

172
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:27,260
from your application are you may not
maybe

173
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,087
of may be far away from it

174
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,975
this situation we don't have access

175
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,864
in this case this car that will be given
to your application to let you know

176
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,100
when that reachability changes see you
might start out

177
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:47,660
with accessory that is not reachable and
for some reason it becomes reachable

178
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,205
you'll be notified and you can update
the UI in your application to reflect

179
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,470
that

180
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:55,072
these are knows what's going on

181
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:59,921
so to describe a little bit more about
how accessories look

182
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:04,571
talk about services so services
represent functionality

183
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,860
%uh accessories they contain
characteristics

184
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,170
so you could describe a service as a
grouping of characteristics for

185
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,206
characteristics

186
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,910
are specific parameters you can interact
with and I'll talk about this next

187
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:22,110
so services are interesting that they
may have

188
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:28,016
name and what that means is there are
some services that really aren't

189
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,815
intended for the user to directly
interact with them

190
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,730
there serve Morgan operational typeof
functionality

191
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:38,792
so here for example we have a light bulb
a service that is a lie Paul

192
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,350
would typically have a name because he
is going to want to name it you know

193
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:45,134
that light has a name I refer to it

194
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:48,452
but a service to update firmware on an
accessory

195
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:51,762
is something that a user typically would
not need to name

196
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,350
and refer to in many different ways it's
something that your application would

197
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,774
take a right for them

198
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,100
present at and in more user-friendly way
than saying oh here's your firmware

199
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,248
update service and here's to

200
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:05,752
the day listen to it so

201
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,392
in your UI generally will not expose
unnamed services

202
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:14,540
so this is a way that some other
messiness if you will or that

203
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:18,066
you can look at it with some the great
functionality the protocol

204
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:22,585
and at home kit remark don't need to be
exposed to users you just wanna

205
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,970
in Iraq to these accessories that
they've got

206
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,486
names accessory except services must be
unique within a home

207
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:34,387
and they are recognized by Siri and
importantly for services

208
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,642
we not only recognize names have
services but also we have

209
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:40,960
Apple defined service types

210
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:44,910
and three understands those types which
means that users can refer to

211
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:48,320
service types using natural language in
synonyms other things like that that may

212
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,144
not be exactly

213
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,705
the name provided to the service

214
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:58,540
services are represented in HM service

215
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,443
we have a name an array of
characteristics the service

216
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:06,982
typeof the service and a pointer back to
the XSD

217
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,530
the services are a collection of
characteristics

218
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:16,174
a good example justice issues here is
for light bulbs service

219
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:20,678
your main characteristic is the power
state

220
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,765
I've that light bulb services to the
power state is a characteristic that you

221
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,854
can directly interact with

222
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:32,178
characteristics provide some information
to meditate about it the characteristics

223
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:36,332
theirself describing see make it a range
making units

224
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:41,043
step values and so on you can display
appropriate controls to user when you

225
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,230
get a characteristic

226
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:49,032
you get the results to a completion
handler because it may not be

227
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:52,308
immediate and characteristics are
recognized by syria although they are

228
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,970
not named by the user

229
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,348
so we've defined a number of
characteristic types

230
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:04,247
and and your candor stand with those
mean caesar's can interact with those

231
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,600
giving commands to Siri

232
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:11,615
two characteristics can be a few
varieties

233
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,288
with these main one so some
characteristics you only read the values

234
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,091
from them so you might see what is that

235
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,730
current temperature outside are inside
you have a thermostat it tells you the

236
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:25,652
current ever hear me to write to the
current temperature you

237
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:30,730
can't directly immediately change that
with additional command

238
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:33,932
when you read from when you wanna change
the temperature you need to tell your

239
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:37,589
thermostat that you have a new target
temperature

240
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:40,676
your target temperature is something
that you do right to

241
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,467
in the ass to read from that because you
might say is why is it so

242
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:49,350
hot in here what is that current target
temperature at this

243
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:53,624
thermostat you read that may be right
and change it

244
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,985
and there are some few characteristics
that you only

245
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,403
right to writing right only
characteristic is something

246
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,888
to think about it a little bit but where
you tell the accessory to do something

247
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,220
and it's going to do it

248
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:12,081
in it doesn't matter what it may have to
say

249
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,290
back to you there's no feedback is just
that the country does it independently

250
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,470
on its own

251
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,252
so an example here an important one is
the identify characteristic which is a

252
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,768
special characteristic that Paul

253
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:27,175
accessories must support and provides an
interface

254
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,773
where from your application you can
where user

255
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,680
say hey I'd like you to help me find out
which one which one of my accessories

256
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:35,273
this

257
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:38,714
is you send in identify characteristic
right

258
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:43,160
to that accessory and then it

259
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:47,965
will do something that identifies itself
to the user so a light bulb might flash

260
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:52,198
thermostat my blinking LED a garage door
opener IP camera might be

261
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:56,072
maybe also flashlight whatever it is
this is accessory specific

262
00:16:56,729 --> 00:17:00,738
and the purpose is to help the user know
which thing and they are about to

263
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,470
interact with

264
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,062
especially useful when a user for
example say

265
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:08,100
connects several lights and they say
okay now I need to set up my lights

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,014
which one is this

267
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:13,953
right they all have the same default
information not going to look them up by

268
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,240
serial number that's

269
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:19,050
boring so just identify that for me

270
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:23,584
and you send the identify characteristic
right to direct it accessory

271
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,090
it plans to use our notes which one it
is they can proceed

272
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:32,235
so characteristics are in HM
characteristic

273
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:35,687
you can read value with completion
handler to get the value of a

274
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,620
characteristic

275
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:41,075
and also right value with completion
handler

276
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:45,494
him

277
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:50,169
so now we've talked about

278
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,870
these these object these things they
correspond to physical things in the

279
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,876
real world

280
00:17:55,659 --> 00:18:00,697
we need to be able to find and set up
these accessories

281
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,039
we do that with the accessory browser

282
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,044
so this cool lets you in your
application find out if there are any

283
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,544
new accessories available

284
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,100
and then help the user had those two
home

285
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,820
so you create in to YouTube accessory
browser

286
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:21,681
said the delegate and then when
appropriate

287
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:26,430
you start searching for new accessories

288
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:29,533
you'll find some you'll remove some of
talk about that next

289
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:34,250
and in later when you're done you stop
searching for you accessories

290
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:37,534
so it's responsible for power management
to stop searching for new accessories

291
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,460
when

292
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:41,485
no longer necessary to do that if left
the view

293
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,580
leaving application you decided that
enough time has passed and so on

294
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,110
so while you're searching for new
accessories you'll get

295
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:53,035
this call back

296
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:56,135
did find new accessory will come at a
pointer to the accessory that was found

297
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,040
and you can now for example add this to
a listed accessories in the UI the user

298
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,097
can select from for which ones they want
to configure

299
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:06,896
be if when you start searching there are
already some accessories that have been

300
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:08,773
found

301
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,240
you can get the list from the to
surprise her out the RT

302
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:15,573
found new accessories and then you get
this

303
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,990
come back every time anyone is added to
that list

304
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:24,132
in when you found the new accessories
and you'd like to set one up the mop

305
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:29,125
you to add that accessory to a whole
it's important to note

306
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:34,034
that this method is on

307
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,261
HM home it's not on the accessory
browser

308
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,570
sorry padded the accessory to a home

309
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,124
when the accessory successfully added to
a home it's time to name the accessory

310
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:50,112
and assign it to a room

311
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:53,019
also while you're searching for new
accessories she will sometimes get this

312
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:53,175
call back

313
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:58,119
especially you'll get this call back
when you add an accessory to a home

314
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,084
this is did remove new accessory this
allows you

315
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,293
in your UI when you have a listed
accessories that you are showing to the

316
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:06,720
user which

317
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,171
you accessories would you like to
configure and they do select one and

318
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:11,670
they do add it to a home

319
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,750
you get this call back to tell you it
removed from the listed new accessories

320
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:20,104
in this case because it was added to our
homes you can update your UI to take

321
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:25,110
that one of the list

322
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:29,025
so that's a 8 quick introduction to how
to get started

323
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:32,122
basic functionality

324
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:36,581
and if you like I have been recently
you'd like to

325
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,843
get right into it and write something
and you wonder

326
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:46,516
how we gonna do that we don't have any
of these hunting accessories yet

327
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:51,403
so we thought about that we came up with
something we have a great solution which

328
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:53,500
is the home kit accessory simulator

329
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:56,664
and this is available for you in Xcode

330
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,186
at this location and it's a great tool

331
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,450
and I'm going to show you

332
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:07,112
how that works

333
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:12,050
beautiful

334
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:16,039
so here is our home kit accessory
simulator macon see

335
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,084
that in this case there are a number of
accessories that have already been

336
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,084
created

337
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,133
in the simulator but I'll walk you
through it

338
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,472
to making sure it's big enough for
everybody to see in the back come

339
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:31,805
forward if you can see it

340
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:35,133
so here on the left we have the listed
accessories that are created and bridges

341
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,174
which I'll talk about briefly

342
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,670
at the end and on the right there's
information about

343
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:43,470
the accessories so I'm gonna do as I'm
gonna go down to this:

344
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:47,246
at accessory but here in the bottom left
and choose to add a new accessory

345
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,970
so make all this

346
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:54,175
assured demo 213

347
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:58,214
in at this accessory CRC now that

348
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,894
I've added a new accessory to the
accessory simulator

349
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:08,250
and let me show you what that looks like

350
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:11,164
in this very very simple

351
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,405
sample app that we wrote

352
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:18,625
so this is just the tab tab you can see
their new accessories I want have been

353
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,700
configured accessories

354
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:25,566
on the other his other accessories are
already configured

355
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:30,970
you see here that we have the chrysler
general accessory that I've just created

356
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:34,172
has shown up here on the new accessories
happen

357
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:39,521
but it's not very interesting yet it
just has an accessory information

358
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:43,340
services created by default because all
accessories must

359
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:47,069
have an accessory information service so
I can go up here

360
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:52,048
to added another service so this is a
garage door so it at a garage door

361
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,960
opener service we can see that added

362
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:57,108
with all these characteristics

363
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:01,487
and now since garage door openers
typically also have a light

364
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,100
but satellite and I see we've created

365
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:09,010
our garage door opener accessory and it
has

366
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,022
the Access to Information Service it has

367
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:16,331
the garage door opener service which
corresponds to the motor but actually

368
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,582
opening closes the garage door

369
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:23,092
and we have a light bulb service
correspond to the white the time that

370
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:25,570
garage door

371
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:28,916
so let's go ahead and configure

372
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,620
the successor so

373
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:36,107
when we go to add an accessory to a home
the user must enter setup code this

374
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:39,034
comes from the accessory

375
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:44,057
began the packaging on i-label around
the screen or LCD an accessory

376
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:49,057
in the simulator it's your right under
the name is he said it could

377
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:53,776
which looks like it's 9143

378
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:59,950
let me into that

379
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:02,123
had set that up and you can see now that
disappears from the listed new

380
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:08,071
accessories because it was successfully
added to the home

381
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:15,071
now for jump over here to the configured
accessories tab

382
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:19,940
I think I saw that I have a 8

383
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:24,095
revealing my practicing but here we have
the garage door

384
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,184
accessory that I just added and you can
see that it has

385
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:31,600
to services any details tab the Details
tab

386
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:35,007
shows the accessory information

387
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,157
is not something that we need to
interact with but it's there for

388
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:40,110
reference

389
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:44,650
we can also go and see all of the
characteristics

390
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:49,757
for the garage door and all the
characteristics for the way

391
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:55,190
and just to show that these are
connected we can see if I

392
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:58,073
click on a the power characteristic

393
00:24:58,073 --> 00:25:01,352
hav the light the power

394
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:08,470
in the by Bob service at the garage door
goes on and off

395
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:11,876
along with that

396
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,330
sort of in the middle up there

397
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:18,202
okay so that shows you the basic you
serve the

398
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:22,505
economic accessory simulator and also
showing serve the test your browser in

399
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,618
action adding adding accessory and then

400
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,226
China services and characteristics let's
come back to bridges for a moment

401
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,954
two bridges are a special type of
accessory where you have

402
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:38,690
1 accessory that support tom cat
accessory protocol

403
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,408
that connects with iowa's and you have
some other

404
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:45,980
and point accessories that are connected
to the bridge because they don't

405
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:48,161
they can't communicate directly with IRS
for some reason

406
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:52,980
so a typical example maybe a heart that
has some lights behind it that are using

407
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:53,578
some

408
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,097
other protocol so in this case

409
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,230
the hub is the

410
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:05,052
first accessory that home kit connects
to

411
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:08,600
said come down here and i cant had a new
bridge

412
00:26:08,006 --> 00:26:11,079
so let's call this

413
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:17,102
demographic more

414
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:21,411
so it created a bridge now when the
bridge is created you'll see that it is

415
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,521
actually

416
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,840
an accessory that's available so if I go
over to

417
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,133
you accessories that has shown up I
could connect to it right now

418
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:32,044
but it's really very uninteresting

419
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:35,047
we need to add some accessories behind
this bridge

420
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:39,723
so click on add accessories

421
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:46,406
so let's add a light behind the bridge

422
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,100
now we see we've added a light accessory
connected to this bridge

423
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:57,002
well we're here let's go ahead and add
another

424
00:26:57,002 --> 00:27:00,711
late behind average p now have two
lights

425
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,984
in a/c on the right we show the
accessories that are connected to the

426
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:05,950
bridge on the left

427
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:08,284
below the bridge we have the actual
light

428
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:13,210
accessories listed here which show the
services of those now here

429
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:16,060
these are created only with accessory
information to start let's go ahead and

430
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:17,042
add

431
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:21,015
lights to them

432
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:24,892
now go back and look at the bridge issue
that we have a nice view to show you the

433
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:28,570
accessories that are connected behind
the bridge

434
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:32,516
and of course we can pair with the
bridge

435
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,128
just the same way we did before set this
up

436
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:44,072
8107 that appears over here we can go
down to our

437
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,645
connected accessories and I are gonna
see something interesting

438
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:51,490
the dental bridges there and we can
click on that and see that it just has

439
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:52,082
details which show

440
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:55,084
the accessory information at the bridge

441
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:59,373
but the lights are also here so lights
that are behind a bridge

442
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:03,970
are presented to you through home kid
like separate accessories and you can

443
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:06,136
interact directly with those lights even
though there's something in the middle

444
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:10,107
there's always protocol translation
other things going on

445
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:14,706
you have to worry about that you get the
accessory which is what the user really

446
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:15,773
cares about

447
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:21,360
and so you can then interact directly
with these accessories

448
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:27,315
they can be turned on and off similarly

449
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,820
okay

450
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:35,082
so that if the democrats get back to our
slides perfect

451
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:45,064
so the home can access we simulate urs
villain Xcode 6 it axed just like real

452
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:48,041
accessories so when you develop your
application using the simulator

453
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,070
using the hunk accessory simulator
you're doing the real thing

454
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:55,062
when you eventually get real excess res
to connect to

455
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:57,951
they can work the same way they're gonna
be exposed to the same way through home

456
00:28:58,509 --> 00:28:58,970
kit

457
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:01,123
to this is a great way for you to get
started

458
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:08,322
and a great way for you to developing
tester home kit applications to during

459
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:08,568
this

460
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,955
presentation so far we've talked about
all the steps various points along the

461
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:13,341
way

462
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:17,360
for how to get the initial setup

463
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:20,062
have a home in excess getting
accessories added we talked about this

464
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:23,081
no one run through it for you to the
summary

465
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:27,620
so first me to create a home you to
provide the name for the home

466
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:30,145
then we need to add rooms to the home
user adds

467
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:35,107
provides names for those rooms again all
these names I will have to be unique

468
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:40,586
in the added any accessories to use it
as your browser

469
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:44,713
get accessories to the home the user
provides a name for the accessory the

470
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:45,970
user

471
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:50,121
chooses which room to the texas region

472
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:56,970
for the home and after that the music
actually going continue using accessory

473
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,070
can interact with it

474
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:05,007
three applications other applications to
Siri now let's

475
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:12,030
move on some more advanced topics

476
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:16,860
have talked a lot about services in
characteristics

477
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:19,735
and i've talked about

478
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:23,511
something defined by Apple and custom
one so here

479
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:27,556
on the left you can see a list of
services there are some of the services

480
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,840
we've defined

481
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:31,084
you can see the services correspond to
in a broadly

482
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:34,903
accessory type: sir functional groupings
oven

483
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:39,610
characteristics they see on the right

484
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:42,240
as a sampling of some of the
characteristics that we've defined

485
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:46,370
and are many more the and then

486
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:49,125
as I said earlier to

487
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:53,584
encourage innovation invention
creativity

488
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:57,260
we allow definition any custom service
any

489
00:30:57,026 --> 00:31:00,097
custom characteristic an accessory
manufacturer wants to use

490
00:31:00,097 --> 00:31:06,776
with all available to you through home
kit and all of these

491
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,700
services and characteristics that are
defined by

492
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:14,866
Apple are recognized by Syrian
understood by Siri

493
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:20,560
so that users can interact with them a
very natural ways

494
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:24,320
turn something on switch something on

495
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:31,032
right there some other ways that users

496
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,051
all of us I guess refer to things in our
home so

497
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:39,051
cook groupings of rooms like upstairs or
downstairs

498
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:44,087
or maybe the bedrooms two rooms can be
collected into zones

499
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:49,122
it represented an HM zone isn't it an
arbitrary grouping of rooms

500
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:53,471
this is just an association it's not an
ownership relationship

501
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:58,755
so a room can be in any number it sounds
zones also are uniquely named

502
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:06,529
and zones are recognized by Siri

503
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:11,075
we have another typeof grouping which is
to help

504
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:17,084
group in refer to functionality that is
provided by accessories

505
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:20,120
we may want to do something across
multiple accessories we don't

506
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:22,026
necessarily need to control

507
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:26,083
everything on the accessory so he called
service group

508
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:30,172
in HM service crew so you can imagine
you might have

509
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:34,104
night lights in your home or some other
night later their own accessory but some

510
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:36,023
night lights are to

511
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:39,039
it's a light on a coffee machine at a
light on a microwave it too late on the

512
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,128
refrigerator to light on whatever it is

513
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:45,045
and he can grab all of these light
services that are actually Night Lights

514
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:47,061
you can group them together into a
service group

515
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:50,144
and you can he easily display that to
use you can easily perform operations on

516
00:32:51,044 --> 00:32:52,051
all of those

517
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:57,051
Night Lights services can be in any
number of groups this is Justin

518
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:58,053
Association

519
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:01,115
service which are also named

520
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:05,036
uniquely of course in a home and

521
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:12,036
into service groups are also recognized
by Siri and now

522
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:17,164
getting into couple more things that are
that are quite interesting

523
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:21,064
so first her action sets so

524
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:24,085
this is the

525
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:29,094
home kit implementation behind
collecting accessories into scenes

526
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:35,097
to how this works as we take a bunch of
actions

527
00:33:36,024 --> 00:33:39,079
my actions or something you're going to
do to an accessory

528
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:42,114
and regroup those together into an
action set

529
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:48,067
so for example night so we may have a
night action set

530
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:52,122
or night scene and so this night action
set my turn off their lights like a door

531
00:33:53,022 --> 00:33:54,107
closer I'd turn the thermostat down

532
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:58,083
that could be grouped together to be
easily refer to

533
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,094
for the user and usually executed all at
once

534
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:05,118
where they all at once I really mean all
at once

535
00:34:06,018 --> 00:34:10,086
the order execution is undefined so you
can expect

536
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:13,171
that something is always going to happen
before something else in an action set

537
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:16,113
everything would be done at the same
time it's all going to get done

538
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,082
best efforts to everything action sets

539
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:24,421
again uniquely named and recognized by
Siri

540
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,730
so what are these actions

541
00:34:29,073 --> 00:34:32,101
so actions are

542
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:37,029
HM characteristic right actions is a
very literal name

543
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:40,061
because what you're doing an action is
you are writing to a characteristic

544
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:44,110
so for example

545
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:48,230
he may have an action that is close the
garage

546
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:51,025
a single right to a single
characteristic

547
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:54,424
on the garage the garage door opener
service

548
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:58,160
and so that a single actions he would
create action

549
00:34:58,016 --> 00:35:02,061
added to the action set so

550
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,153
actions that there are interested in
either starting to lie to do something

551
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:05,141
more complex

552
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:10,046
we also have triggers

553
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:15,103
the triggers Rahm timer trigger so time
a trigger is set up

554
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:20,046
to fire at a specific date and time they
can repeat

555
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:23,118
their uniquely named in a home but
they're not

556
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:28,097
interacted with to spoken commands but
there's something very special about

557
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:28,159
them

558
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:32,106
which is their actually executed by

559
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,063
I O S in the background at the time

560
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:39,064
when that trigger is suppose to be

561
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:43,074
execute when it fires so the trigger is
set

562
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:50,083
to run in action Sat and

563
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:54,163
that actions that can happen executing
attacks that can happen

564
00:35:55,063 --> 00:36:00,065
even when the latter running or whatever
because the trigger is managed

565
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:07,065
by IRS she can imagine that

566
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:11,112
even with just being able to specify

567
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:15,049
dates and times collections and actions
to happen

568
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:18,118
repeating triggers you can start to get
some pretty interesting functionality

569
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:23,022
so I like to give you a quick Demel

570
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:29,100
action set and triggers work so we have
here hun get accessories simulator

571
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,067
still running and have another

572
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:40,074
very simple sample app to show you

573
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:44,106
place in March this time

574
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:48,030
so here we have in this home is in the
background

575
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:51,028
we have some action set in some triggers
already defined

576
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:55,090
so if you look at these actions that we
have the night action satire

577
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:58,047
example I gave earlier we also have

578
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:02,037
lights on in light of action set

579
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:05,092
so if you look at the night action set
were displayed here

580
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:08,092
all of the characteristic right that are
part

581
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:12,106
love this action Sep and

582
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:17,031
free go and look at for example some
things here so the

583
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:20,034
thermostats target temperature say that
with

584
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:24,060
said it seventy we can

585
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:28,006
go here and

586
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:31,061
unlock the door for example now you can
go here in this action said you can see

587
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,038
that the

588
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:36,093
door lock is gonna have the lock
characteristic

589
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:40,187
set to locked the thermostat is going to
have the target temperature set to 68

590
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:44,136
so I can execute this action set we can
see that

591
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:48,068
the lock has indeed changed to lock
thermostat target temperature has

592
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:50,071
changed back to 68

593
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:53,114
and these lights are off

594
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:57,087
so simple way once it's all set up very
simple way

595
00:37:57,087 --> 00:38:02,166
to go in control many accessories same
time

596
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:07,149
so now let's look at his other two so

597
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:12,058
bites on simply turns on all the way

598
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,078
might of obviously turns off the lights

599
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:19,110
to these two actions that's just give me
the opportunity to show you a very

600
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:20,099
simple

601
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:24,100
demos triggers work so we have here to
triggers that are created

602
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,068
one runs the actions that lights on and
one runs the action set lights off

603
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:32,075
ok we can see that when I've turned

604
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:36,038
these triggers on Ivan able done that
these

605
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:40,107
lights just start blinking happen not a

606
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:44,080
a commonly used to use case in the real
world but a great

607
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:48,072
example for a demo so let's stop that

608
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:55,068
triggers and actions at

609
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:58,140
to go back to the side

610
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:03,007
so using action certain triggers
together you'll be able to script

611
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:08,058
or allow the user to script some fairly
complex and interesting interactions

612
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:11,136
and enable you and your users

613
00:39:12,036 --> 00:39:18,118
to control many accessories very easily
very quickly

614
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:24,037
so

615
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:27,066
one more thing I want to tell you about
home kit

616
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:29,145
as you're looking through our
documentation going to see there are a

617
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,093
lot of delegate methods

618
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:35,187
and you might ask do i do I need

619
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:39,155
I love these delegate methods do I have
to

620
00:39:40,055 --> 00:39:43,066
implement every single one and

621
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:47,091
now more yes there there for a reason

622
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:49,146
they're there because if you remember
back at the beginning in the

623
00:39:50,046 --> 00:39:54,054
presentation we talked about the shared
database

624
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:58,146
and because the shared at the shared
database we get this great

625
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:03,048
consistency across the user experience

626
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:06,075
different applications that have
different specialized purposes

627
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:10,152
users going to see that all the tabs are
aware of their home

628
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:13,066
they have their home setup they have
their living room they have their

629
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:16,115
kitchen they have their ceiling lights
they're gonna see that in every app

630
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:21,092
right in a field great to users using

631
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:24,164
you don't want your apt to get out of
sync

632
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:29,073
with what the user knows they have set
up for their home

633
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:33,102
and because at this shared database you
can be updated

634
00:40:34,002 --> 00:40:38,089
in many different ways many of those
ways are not through your app

635
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:43,094
for some other after some other event
accessories are changing

636
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,040
and so all these delegate methods are
how

637
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:50,052
we tell you what's changing

638
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,177
and some change the name in that room
that

639
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,084
accessory state has changed

640
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:03,048
someone has added a should be so lucky
at a lake house

641
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:06,053
to their their collection of homes and
so

642
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:09,137
when these things happen you wanna be
able to update your app

643
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:13,075
to the user sees that your app is
connected your apt knows what's going on

644
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:17,093
everything is being communicated to
these delegate methods are how

645
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:22,162
you do that

646
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:26,077
so that brings us just about the end of

647
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:29,089
my presentation in a fish timers right
