1
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:16,088
well come o come for session till seven
accessibility and North

2
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:19,182
10 my name is patty Hou I'm souter
engineer on the last 10

3
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:23,084
accessibility team today

4
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:27,117
my colleague Chris Dillon I and II are
extremely excited to tell you

5
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:31,050
about this brand new API we have to
install for you

6
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:36,744
that's designed to make your life
simpler but before I talk about that I

7
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,520
want to just touch up

8
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:41,063
on the importance of accessibility

9
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:45,100
and what it means for your application
to be accessible to everyone

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,023
then out show you some examples of how
to use this new API

11
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:55,030
to make some UI accessible

12
00:00:55,003 --> 00:01:00,010
and then also show you some tools they
can use to verify a changes

13
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:03,039
then then latter half of the session

14
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,066
Chris will come up and give you like
them all

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:13,066
of making a game accessible so Apple
would really care about providing

16
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:18,194
the best platform for all users to have
that great and wonderful experience

17
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:23,152
when using your application how I feel
our users

18
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:28,053
I me users with various range abilities

19
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:31,136
dang close those who may be visually
challenged

20
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:36,052
and me arm excuse me

21
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:39,053
those who may be visually challenged and
have trouble seeing

22
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:42,136
the collars and the graphics on that
cation those

23
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,050
who are deaf and hard-of-hearing who may
not be

24
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,008
real to hear the south the back in
application

25
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:52,127
those who may have mobility limitation

26
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:56,068
and then I people use the physical mouse
or keyboard

27
00:01:56,068 --> 00:02:03,068
what a cheap the goal of making sure
that everyone could have equal access

28
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:10,065
Apple workroom lonely heart provide
hud's up accessibility solutions

29
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,940
built right into OS 10 and now includes
products such as

30
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,126
voice-over design for the visually
impaired user

31
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:23,032
switch control designed for model
compare users who may only people to use

32
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:24,035
a single swish

33
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:29,038
to operate the computer close captioning

34
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:32,043
for the deaf and hard-of-hearing and
tons and tons of

35
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:35,187
other great accessibility features don't
want a left n

36
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:39,143
but all of these features are simply

37
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:43,110
tolls for the user to use your
application

38
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,070
after all years

39
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,608
your application that they're looking at
whether not as to

40
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,260
re an article or two watch a movie

41
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:58,122
use your application that their
interacting with

42
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:03,080
what whether it's to play a game or to
write a term paper

43
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:07,011
is your application at the Emerald Bay

44
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:12,088
that they're looking forward to use
every day so how do you make sure that

45
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,035
your application

46
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:17,592
a successful to everyone well with

47
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,590
build the foundation for T for you to
build your application

48
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,151
and we have this Walcott accessibility
API

49
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:29,097
take it implement make sure your
applications accessible to everyone

50
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:32,136
so I want to spend the rest of the
session

51
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:37,088
telling you about this API but the first
thing I wanna tell you

52
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,120
s give you are the big picture a hall

53
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:46,087
this accessibility API work and system
saw first there's your application

54
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,008
and then we have what we call a sister

55
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:54,777
suffer such as voice-over in such
control help users

56
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:58,770
to perceive understand interact with
your application

57
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:01,172
and that happens through a channel well
are what we call

58
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:05,131
a accessibility API

59
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:10,048
and so that's why i wanna talk to you
about today

60
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:14,049
estas accessibility API which for all
last 10

61
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:17,707
yosemite I'll we create a funk roundup

62
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:22,630
this brand new API I am excited to tell
you about this

63
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:27,782
sort with well worth were first Zionist
a PI we have few things in mind

64
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,390
actually just one goal

65
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,768
and that is to simplify to make it easy
for you to use

66
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:39,860
and to show you just how easy is to use
this API

67
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:42,111
al walk you through a few examples

68
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:47,440
so what you see on the screen for sale
is a window that contains

69
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:52,270
like a media player controller so what
we're gonna do is focus on

70
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:55,033
the UI's in the middle why CEOs

71
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:58,772
airs everyone play and follow a button

72
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,069
well how do I come to that conclusion
because

73
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,120
visually you could see three distinct

74
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:10,061
icons and each of those i Carl represent
something

75
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,266
well if you're not sided eat the Pegasus
to suffer like voice-over

76
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,580
to help you perceive what's on the
screen

77
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:23,397
what this is what a voice-over user
we'll probably see

78
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,240
just a bunch of buttons they will know
what to do with them

79
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:31,853
even worse if you implement them

80
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,330
as custom views dorsey

81
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:40,452
nothing not terribly accessible is it

82
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:44,796
while today I'm gonna show you how to
make the issue lies accessible

83
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:49,226
so what do first we'll focus on just one
button in the middle

84
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,550
the play button

85
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:55,394
if you say you're using app to control
you're in luck

86
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,960
because you get most of that
accessibility for free

87
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:06,646
by default ako already fill in all the
accessibility information

88
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:12,091
for that he's a view I knowing that it's
a button I ever afters not psychic

89
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,382
it's not gonna be with the No what the
funk showed that Biden what do

90
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,261
that's something only you the developer
well now

91
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,704
and so that's where you come in to help
label

92
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:26,327
this button so this too late to do it

93
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,830
you going to exclude Co %uh identity
inspector

94
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,482
under the accessibility I didn't ease
section

95
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:38,295
you could just added description play

96
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,947
so this is you could do that and as a
file or if you'd like to do this

97
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,050
programmatically

98
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:47,114
you can simply going to your
initialization Co

99
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,218
and in your button cells simply set the

100
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:57,749
accessibility label property to beat the
localized string that you wanted to be

101
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,770
and with just that low now a voice-over
user could be

102
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:06,926
be able to perceive this as a play
button

103
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:10,621
what makes it so easy well

104
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,644
with the new API which is a method based
API with Cumbernauld

105
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:18,698
attributes into properties sold just
like

106
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,823
any some object to see property

107
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:25,256
you could now yet and set the property

108
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:32,589
directly armed object itself see no
longer have to subclass

109
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,515
cell whenever possible your staff to
control

110
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,871
before any reason you can use apt-get
after controlling have to do your own

111
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,200
stuff like creating custom view for each
of the UI

112
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:51,593
when this case obviously was over a long
nap yet to see anything on the screen

113
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:55,901
scenario wondering great is a lot more
have to do

114
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,734
well the good thing is

115
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,320
s just as easy if used to spread your
API

116
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,187
you cunt any use to accessibility
property I just mention

117
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:11,663
I gave you an example Dr tweaking one
that the property the label property

118
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:16,085
there's tons a property CPU's but won a
talent for developers

119
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,384
knowing exactly which property you have
to implement

120
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,015
so now we've introduce accessibility
park all

121
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,468
that's designed to take that guesswork
out of the equation

122
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,080
ilk how the park also guide you through
the whole implementation process so you

123
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:34,013
know exactly which property you have to
implement

124
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,025
now we have forecast that should cover
most of the commonly

125
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:40,100
used type love you ice out there

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,055
so how do you go about implementing this
while farce you have to pick up or call

127
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,063
so we have a look at the park all seeker
choose from so you should pick one

128
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:53,122
that RESPA that corresponds to doesn't
look and

129
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:58,451
feel love you I the way Dr the function
love that you I

130
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:03,850
us so in our case we have example while
showing earlier with the play button

131
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:07,804
in looks and behaves like a button so
we're gonna pick the button protocol

132
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:12,880
sawyer interface filed simply say I here
to diana's

133
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:15,092
accessibility button

134
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:18,491
so now he at that you compile

135
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,630
the good thing is now exculpate compiler
will tell you

136
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:27,066
give you some warning and tell you what
you need to implement so in this case

137
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,166
are you have to implement the
accessibility perform Press

138
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:37,110
and accessibility label methods so it's
gonna do that

139
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:43,008
selling your implementation file simply
for the accessibility label

140
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:48,071
method just return a localized string
the were play

141
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:53,202
for the accessibility perform Press you
simply need to

142
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,675
perform the action a pressing a button

143
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:01,531
so what's next there's no next step

144
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,290
that's all that's just how easy is too
important an

145
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:11,087
accessibility even for custom view

146
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:15,926
so what makes it so easy what's because
packets doing a lot of work on your

147
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:17,790
behalf

148
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,155
by simply using this protocol ako what
inferred that

149
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:28,106
East elements are accessibility elements
and depending on which protocol you use

150
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:32,092
have Caleb on a popularly information
like what the role it

151
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:35,094
so if for example if I use the MS
accessibility

152
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:38,993
fun Procol ako wala macklin for Dad the
role for this

153
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,120
this button

154
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:48,351
size the to see how easy is to use I
also have her give you a little bit more

155
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,464
detail by these protocol

156
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,990
I am so the first mother's to Bass Pro
call

157
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:57,099
was what we call the MS accessibility
alman protocol

158
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:01,156
has a few require method like the
fraying and accessibility parent

159
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:06,064
dust-up basic information that all
accessibility Alysha half

160
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:11,755
and the bill on top of that we have all
the other protocols

161
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,086
like the button Procol I just talked
about which has

162
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:19,237
to require method accessibility label
inaccessibility perform Press

163
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:24,690
can St Salt earlier ex-cop compiler
already won its about

164
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:30,072
those methods

165
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:34,135
so that's just how easy a simple man a a
custom view

166
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:38,110
on by the way the Protocols of snow so
you don't have to implement

167
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:43,027
if you don't want to but it's relief
really can be

168
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:48,705
so let's go through another example
that's a little bit more complicated

169
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:55,750
on the screen you see are six different
in the shapes

170
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:58,166
the way to developer may have
implemented is simply a custom view

171
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:03,045
what they're doing their own drawing

172
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,696
safety have something like this

173
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:12,660
someone like a voice-over user was still
need to be able to know that there's six

174
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,160
this think you I sitting on a screen

175
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:20,985
so you have two rappers again and
accessibility representation

176
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:27,000
foot each other image that's been purse
play on the screen

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,062
so how do you do that for you I stagger
rendering yourself

178
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:33,065
and you don't have a in as few backing

179
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:37,051
well for the interview who are from the
lowest I'll all simple call we have

180
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,360
something call for you our men

181
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:43,041
and now with the new API we have a
formalized version

182
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:46,365
that car and this accessibility helmet

183
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,202
you can use this class to support all
the issue I've that do not have a back

184
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:54,290
in s few

185
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,081
so let's see how you go about
implementing thats

186
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:00,105
sell for the example earlier with the
image

187
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:04,048
the six shape images foot each of those

188
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:07,106
in a you want to create an NS
accessibility

189
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:12,030
Alama instance for that

190
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:16,005
sell you create one of the sisters and
then he set up some of the accessibility

191
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,324
properties for that such as:

192
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,902
with the parent s what their role is
well in this case which is gonna say

193
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:23,220
these are

194
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:27,025
initial and then give it a unique label

195
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:30,118
and then set up with a friend this

196
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:35,085
so when that custom view containing
custom view is being asked for the

197
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:36,764
accessibility children

198
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:41,541
then this is where year returned your
array up NS accessibility

199
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:44,657
alumax

200
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,500
and one thing I do wanna know is you
should keep geese

201
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,850
I accessibility Alma alive as long as
they are

202
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:56,092
on-screen that's because assistive
suffer like voice-over

203
00:13:56,092 --> 00:14:01,321
could be asking information about these
objects at anytime through I PC costs

204
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,153
so as long as there are screaming a

205
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:10,660
cash in a row

206
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:14,185
pic sub that was pretty simple even for
something like that where you

207
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:19,833
are rendering own UI so there might be a
few viewing audience who

208
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:24,346
may have already implemented
accessibility with it all API

209
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:29,160
your application you're wondering why
how does this apply to me

210
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:33,041
what he already at accessibility into
your application

211
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,073
there is no actual work for you you all

212
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:40,162
API ko will continue to work just fine

213
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:45,110
because the new API as binary and source
compatible

214
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:49,170
so you don't have to worry up but if you
do you like to try out the new

215
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:52,269
API and we do encourage you to do so

216
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,990
you could continue to do so the whole
Cole will continue to work alongside

217
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:59,808
the new code

218
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,781
so I just told you why should make your
application accessible

219
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,540
and a run through a few examples houten

220
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:11,136
use this brainy API to make some UI
successful

221
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:16,080
you saw how quickly and easily wheeling
we were able to

222
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:19,027
a meets all the threes

223
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:22,308
examples that show you

224
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,060
and it really is fast anoche sometime

225
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:31,062
for you to develop and making sure your
act as accessible

226
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:36,071
cell with some eckstein you may have my
hand I really hope you could take some

227
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:37,673
of that time too

228
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:41,157
do some testing because after all

229
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:45,030
no the co you act you wanna make sure
you will be

230
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,822
usable by everyone so how do you go Bell

231
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,490
and making sure that your app is
accessible

232
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:56,588
after you make those changes what we
have to toss it to use

233
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:01,040
the first test accessibility inspector

234
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,660
this is a tool that display all the
accessibility information for

235
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:08,085
any piece %uh view i'd is currently on
that the mouse

236
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:11,254
and with the new OS for share after
inspector

237
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:15,086
will now displayed their accessibility
properties

238
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:19,745
love that you I so this is really
helpful so you know exactly which

239
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:24,360
properties he may need to treat

240
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:27,054
the second for we have

241
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:30,973
is called voice-over voice-over as a
screen reader

242
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:35,482
artist design for the visually
challenged users to be able to

243
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:38,702
explore and interact with the content

244
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:41,826
have the screen can get the use else

245
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,928
will get feedback throws speech or
terrell

246
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,980
said how do you go about using less well
first you gotta turn are

247
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:52,247
if you just remembered the shortcut
command f5

248
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:57,930
now we turn our or it going to the
accessibility Prof paying

249
00:16:57,093 --> 00:17:00,097
there's a enable voice over checkbox

250
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:03,106
simply check that and yucatan voice-over
are

251
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:08,088
so the very first time he turned voice
over our its gonna prompt you

252
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:11,106
to see if you wanna go tho tutorial cell
if you just click on the

253
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:17,106
learn click the Learn More button then a
run through a tutorial with you

254
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:22,089
so I really encourage you to try that
man through the tutorial

255
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,538
now voice-over SF very powerful tool

256
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,200
so has hundreds of commands but today

257
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:34,025
I'm gonna show you just five simple
commands he could use

258
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:37,062
to be proficient in testing with
voice-over

259
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:42,066
so the first that yes how you navigate
found one piece %uh view I to another

260
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:46,138
and thats control optional by errol for
just remember that once he have was

261
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:48,084
overturned on

262
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:51,093
any time you press Control and option

263
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:54,148
any other key pressed at the same time
what on a manic later

264
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:58,070
into voice over command

265
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:02,061
sup where contraption buyout got
annexing if you want to reverse

266
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:06,031
you do control option left arrow

267
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:10,092
if you wanna press a button are actively
something simply do control options

268
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:10,191
space

269
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,100
this is very similar to pressing space

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,008
be spacebar are something that has a
keyboard focus

271
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:23,103
and then we have to what commands wires
as intergroup which is contraption shift

272
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:25,102
on a roll

273
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:29,098
a relief group contraption shift apparel

274
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:32,164
so what is group well voice-over have
this concept

275
00:18:33,064 --> 00:18:37,102
up group and it goes like this: if you
have on the screen

276
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:41,004
I am what I have on the screen is just
someone

277
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:46,053
when does not have you I while to two
people navigate quickly to

278
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:50,071
certain piece %uh view I nm Momin was
over have this concept

279
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:54,071
grouping so honest greasy three
different groups one is a toolbar

280
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:57,137
the other one is the tabla folders

281
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,102
Hassall a the collection

282
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,097
the love indigenous sought to be able to

283
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:10,154
interact or just no enter and exit these
group

284
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:14,103
like I said earlier he said he could
just press to enter group

285
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:19,038
or leave group command so was just the
five

286
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,103
voice-over commands along you should be
pretty good and testing with voice-over

287
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:28,012
so not that show you the tools and

288
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:31,101
run you through some example do a using
API dimple

289
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:36,087
simple man you are I am some the UI
example such young

290
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:39,186
earlier i would like to bring up presto
one to come up

291
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:43,094
to give you a like them all love making
the tic tac toe game

292
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:51,066
accessible

293
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:58,126
thanks patty hi my name is Chris and I'm
a software engineer on the OS 10

294
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:00,060
accessibility team

295
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:04,045
and I'm really excited to show you just
how simple and just how easy it is to

296
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:05,175
accessibility to your app

297
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:09,097
with our brand new API to do this

298
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:12,136
I've written a little to stop here and
it's it's a very simple game of

299
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:14,042
tic-tac-toe

300
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:17,068
so in this case the board is full the
game is over and says

301
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:21,073
the O player has won I can come in and
restart the game

302
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:26,063
out play some pieces on the board I can
even turn on the AI opponents in

303
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:30,072
and play against a taken flap this is
very simple application and I i want to

304
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,077
use this covers are launching point to
show you

305
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:36,103
how you wouldn't mind all the different
techniques the padded just told you

306
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,034
in this application but before I do that

307
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:43,117
I want to give you an idea of what this
application look like to someone who's

308
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:47,082
using voice over so they may have just
heard from social media that

309
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:50,177
this is the great new apt to have or
that you wrote in the wanna check it out

310
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:54,148
and this is our first experience with it
and want to keep that in mind

311
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:59,076
so I'm going to use the keyboard command
to turn on voice-over

312
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:03,080
so here two things have happened when I
turn voice over on you are currently on

313
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,107
attack element

314
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,138
the first is that the caption panel has
shown up in the bottom

315
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,040
are bottom corner and all this does is a
house all of the tax that's currently

316
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,023
being spoken

317
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:17,091
so this is really really helpful if I'm
collaborating

318
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:20,140
with someone who's using voice over and
they often have their speech kinda

319
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:22,042
really really fast

320
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:25,086
so here I can read all of the tax that
being spoken

321
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:29,099
helps me on collaborating the second
thing you'll see

322
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:33,134
is that there's a black box stronger
around the axe wins

323
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:38,046
label and we call this the voiceover
cursor you can kind of thing for doesn't

324
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,101
alternate keyboard focus

325
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:43,008
so just like I can produce space on a
keyboard focused on women to do

326
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:44,073
something with that element

327
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:48,099
when I press one of the many voice-over
commands keeper commands

328
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:53,104
that normally act on currently
voice-over focused element

329
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,106
so now what I'd like to do is turn on a
unload

330
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:01,015
in voiceover contract had commander and
all it allows me to do is just

331
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:05,096
explore the UI with my finger just like
voice over on iowa's

332
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:08,133
I can I move around the interface and
voice-over will speak

333
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:12,039
the descriptions all the items
underneath my finger

334
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:16,099
internet on what trackpad commander on

335
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:19,141
and down this going to explore around
the interface and you'll see a blue

336
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,046
circle where mime

337
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:24,111
wherever my fingers close button

338
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:31,060
minimize button damned zoom button great
so the tow bars looking good

339
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,065
but you'll notice anywhere where there's
no elements there's the sounding play it

340
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,051
says this is an empty space

341
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:41,115
tic-tac-toe kind titles gun

342
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:47,088
empty space here axe whens cat the label
shows up fine

343
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:52,172
more empty spaces are we've had our
first problem

344
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,134
there's nothing being reported here for
accessibility for this truck box

345
00:22:57,034 --> 00:23:00,069
so this is one of the problems will have
to fix difficulty

346
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:04,113
difficulties 52 social level button
button

347
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:10,034
him to button button not delete 1.41
percent

348
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:13,051
so we saw there's a problem with the
bonds are just as bun

349
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:16,126
so far not decided you so I don't
understand what's going on with the fam

350
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:20,029
what to do when I click a

351
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:23,068
more empty space

352
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,070
and again the restart game month the
same way there's there's absolutely no

353
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,099
information for tough people do that

354
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,140
what about the grid while I had the same
problem here

355
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:36,078
the grid isn't even being reported
turquoise over of

356
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:40,103
so as you can see the user experience
for this application is quite poor

357
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,059
when using voice over a lot in the major
fun challenge for the top

358
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:48,077
just doesn't show up I can't play a
piece i cant restart the game account

359
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:51,082
I a cam played NCAA are you can I can
click the checkbox

360
00:23:52,027 --> 00:23:56,069
and so what I'd like to do it take you
through each of these individual amounts

361
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:02,138
and show you how out to make them
accessible

362
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,083
so here's my Xcode project and before
even talk about the code

363
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:10,129
I just want to orient you to the Canada
layout at this project

364
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:15,037
so over here to the classic NBC style
apso have all my models and these are

365
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,010
the files

366
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:20,104
that encapsulated you know those tic tac
toe board in the game rules and

367
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:25,018
how what it means to win the game record
a touch any other model files here this

368
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:27,109
is the games that we don't need that

369
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:32,034
the next folder is all the views so we
have a lot to custom UI in this

370
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,110
application

371
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:37,090
and we need to use to backed them and
these are all the files are used to do

372
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:38,132
that

373
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:43,074
this is where we're gonna be spending a
majority over time in the code

374
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:46,127
now said the controller section the app
delegate is currently empty

375
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,035
and the tic tac to view controller is
the thing that hooks up all the UI

376
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:54,028
interactions with the model objects

377
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:57,046
the last thing and I want to point out
as the main menu Neb

378
00:24:57,046 --> 00:25:00,073
this is the one and only need for this
entire project

379
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:03,087
and this is actually where we're gonna
start

380
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:07,091
to the first elements were gonna work on
are the plus and minus buttons here for

381
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:09,065
the difficulty

382
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:11,158
if you remember this is one of the items
that we could land on but there's no

383
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:13,145
contextual information about

384
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,104
what these buttons dan so I'd like to
show you how to add accessibility to

385
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:20,023
time two different with

386
00:25:20,023 --> 00:25:23,024
the first is actually quite simple I I'm
just going to select

387
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:27,109
that element and Interface Builder and
end up in the top right

388
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:31,091
I can open up the panel and the third

389
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:34,175
icon from the locked is the identity
inspector

390
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:39,101
and in here as the accessible the
identity information:

391
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:43,013
this is we're going to add the
description for the spine

392
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:47,036
so what does this button do well when I
click it it decreases the difficulty

393
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:51,111
some gather I'm just contact on here

394
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:56,015
great not allowed to do very simple

395
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:59,113
so what about if I decided I want to do
the same thing

396
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:03,030
but in code well turns out that's really
simple to

397
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:06,022
taking over to my view controller

398
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:13,049
and my week from near here I can play
out the button cell

399
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:20,050
and I have an outlet

400
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:24,041
2.1 and then I can use one of the new
accessibility property is to just sad

401
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:28,104
the accessibility label

402
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:36,004
and remember you always want to %uh
localize the strings

403
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:42,024
and this is the increase difficulty
button

404
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:45,026
I'm just glad that in

405
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:48,072
okay just like that that's all I need to
do and

406
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:52,118
our without now in a voiceover user
lands on his plus-minus puns

407
00:26:53,018 --> 00:26:58,020
will be writers the increased difficulty
or the decrease difficulty button

408
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,066
so why do we get that accessibility for
free why did they even show up in the

409
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,069
first place

410
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:06,119
won't this custom classes actually
subclasses and thats button

411
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,025
so we've done a lot to work behind the
scenes to be fixable the in

412
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,085
to all the standard up controls so
whenever possible try to use those cuz

413
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:16,094
we done as much work as possible for you

414
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,175
the one thing you need to do is just add
a description which is which is quite

415
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,137
simple

416
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:25,060
so now we've worked on the plus or minus
buttons let's move on to the restart

417
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:26,010
game button

418
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:30,066
now you might recall that this was one
other item side by nothing was reported

419
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:31,163
there for accessibility

420
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:35,097
let's take a look at why

421
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:40,145
so have a class with button and the
first thing I immediately notice

422
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:45,117
isn't it in and ask you some class son
doing a lot of actual work behind the

423
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:46,080
scenes

424
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:50,030
to make this view act and look like a
bum this includes all my own keyboard

425
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:51,065
and

426
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:54,071
now so than handling as walls hold my
own drying

427
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:57,108
handing out on an extra work here while

428
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:01,012
how do I am accessibility to the so on

429
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:04,049
turns out it's also quite simple all I
need to do his pic

430
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:09,063
the accessibility protocol that best
represents the subject

431
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,075
and the protocol for this as the an ass
accessibility

432
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:16,123
button protocol none other from conform
to that protocol

433
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:20,032
I can move into my infant Asian file

434
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:25,028
and the first thing I see if I get to
new warnings

435
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:28,101
so this is really really helpful for me
because now I know exactly what I need

436
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:29,065
to implement

437
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:33,067
to at accessibility to the south custom
control

438
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:36,116
to the two methods here are accessible
the label and accessibility perform

439
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:37,074
props

440
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:40,077
sought to take those one at a time

441
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:44,037
have a section here for accessibility
and the first one

442
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:48,079
is accessible the label

443
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,170
tree now what do I want to be returned
here

444
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:56,079
I happen to know that this bun is only
ever used to

445
00:28:57,042 --> 00:29:04,042
draw the restart game 1 so the label for
this is just going to be restarted

446
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:12,298
at the

447
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,658
to now I can go back up to the top in my
file a nurse at warning has gone away

448
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:19,612
so only have one more matter to
implement and that accessibility perform

449
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:20,700
Press

450
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:27,007
for to do that warm prompt:

451
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:33,140
so what should happen here well when I
use the mouse to interact with the

452
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:34,062
spartan

453
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:38,117
when I click it something happens right
that seem something should happen

454
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:42,071
when an accessible declined so pay I
want to activate this item

455
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,105
so in my case I happen to have

456
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:50,090
in method compress down or perform press
rather

457
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:54,031
and perform crosses what gets called
when the mouse hand in large excels

458
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:59,020
yes this button has been pressed so I
want to call that same exact method

459
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:06,002
now you notice accessible to perform
price return

460
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:11,100
returns a boolean and this is a yes or
no did I handle this

461
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,559
a band and and always handle in so yes I
return

462
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,220
yes and with that I can go back up to
the top in my file

463
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:23,110
and I C all of my mornings have gone
away Sutter

464
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:27,044
the protocol has got me through what I
need to do that accessibility

465
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:32,078
implemented our and I'm from another

466
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:35,154
are the slower rate sections finished I
want to work on the artificial

467
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:36,120
intelligence

468
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,097
checkbox if you recall again this was
another element that was invisible to

469
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:42,019
accessibility at all

470
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:46,108
so I have my header file here for the
check box

471
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:50,037
and again I see the same situation I
haven't the button

472
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:53,045
it's an an issue some cock so do a lot
of work

473
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:57,144
to make it look and act like a checkbox
some this case

474
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:01,050
and you to pick a protocol in the
protocol for this

475
00:31:02,004 --> 00:31:05,028
the Anna success ability checkbox
protocol

476
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:08,052
and now

477
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:12,124
when I go into my implementation file I
get a few new warnings

478
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:17,119
to this tells me what I need to do to
make the check box accessible to the

479
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,057
three warnings I have here

480
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:22,057
accessible the value accessible the
label

481
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:25,116
and accessibility perform price semantic
those

482
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:30,061
I one at a time to the first one

483
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:32,137
and we've seen this one before the
excitable the label something to that

484
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:33,846
first

485
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:40,740
so what should be the label for the
strike box

486
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:43,082
well this is a control diet designed I
follow my reuse

487
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:48,071
I in other places factually haven't I've
are around that keeps the check box

488
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:48,127
taxed

489
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:52,112
and this is the string actually gets
rendered an and Ron are in the dryer act

490
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:53,017
math and

491
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:56,108
so I can just return

492
00:31:57,008 --> 00:32:00,020
the check box text here great

493
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:04,003
for my morning has gone away the next 1i
want to work on

494
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:07,068
is accessibility perform Press so just
like the bond money

495
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:10,127
interact with us control using the mouse
something happens

496
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:15,054
it and changes the checked state I need
that same something to happen

497
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:19,061
when the trouble to clients say hey I
want to interact with the filament

498
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:22,133
so that's the accessibility perform
price

499
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:29,038
and I have

500
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:33,104
a method called title track stain and
this is what it's called

501
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:37,020
from the mass handling logic and just
like with the bun

502
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:40,036
return yes I didn't fact handle birth

503
00:32:40,054 --> 00:32:46,077
thus action not to go back up to the top
issue that I still have one

504
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:49,138
more methane you to implement and this
is acceptable devalue

505
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,057
at this point I ask myself all what is
the value for a check box where my

506
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:54,148
supposed to return

507
00:32:55,048 --> 00:33:00,079
refer to really really hard to try to
answer all these questions in one place

508
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,100
we tried to make and a successful the
protocol file

509
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,095
the one stop shop for this missus were
all the protocols are implementing

510
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:11,172
are defined so in another tower how the
spur close file

511
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:16,139
and there's the and a successful the
check box protocol right here

512
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,072
and I see under the required methods the
excitable the value

513
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:24,084
returns an annus number okay so the
answer is my first question

514
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:27,170
and says I return yeah subtract or know
if I'm track

515
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,008
great it's not have this information

516
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:34,066
can come down here and implement an
actor

517
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,046
so here I have another

518
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:43,145
I I've are around which is and I checked
or not and I can use that to return

519
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:50,559
yeah or no

520
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:56,977
return

521
00:33:57,049 --> 00:34:00,960
okay snacking a back up to the top in my
file I see all the warnings have gone

522
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:00,555
away

523
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:04,970
so this is all I need to do to him from
and accessible checkbox

524
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:09,746
to now the entire right hand side over
application

525
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,200
has added the Sun basic a class ability
to it so let's work on the next part

526
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:17,053
which is the grid and this is perhaps
the most difficult part

527
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:22,084
again I'm gonna go back into my project

528
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:25,343
and I have a a view representing the
board

529
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,470
means the board for you and here I
notice it again

530
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:33,083
nanosphere some doing all of my own
drawing here and in fact this class

531
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:37,169
draws the board and all the pieces so

532
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:42,107
and it made a successful and I need to
pick a protocol now to what protocol

533
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:47,546
do I need well the way that I like to
think about the tic tac toe board

534
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,060
it's really a collection up squares rain

535
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:55,008
every time I interact with the border
it's not so much a bored I wanna play

536
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:58,024
the square I want to put my piece there
I want to get three no

537
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:02,073
bro to win I want to block my opponent
from getting three in a row and so this

538
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:05,115
the sport is really a collection to me
and the way that that's

539
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:10,053
the protocol that you can use to
represent that the CNS accessibility

540
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:10,099
group

541
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:14,114
protocol it's a collection of things
great

542
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:22,014
to now go to my implementation file and
i notice I have

543
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:30,093
no warning showing up

544
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:34,861
and no one's so does this mean while

545
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:38,377
I have no required methods that they
need to implement for the acceptable

546
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:39,815
degree protocol

547
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,720
by just like with Reese what we saw the
other elements

548
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:47,911
I can still and accessibility to and I
so what's the first thing I want to do

549
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,880
while the board you when I land on its a
group

550
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:56,117
and i won some label to describe it to
just like with all the other controls

551
00:35:57,017 --> 00:36:00,046
I'm going to add I'll a label here

552
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:04,099
inaccessible the labels very simple so
what am I gonna return here

553
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:07,150
while just it's the tic tac toe board
some the voiceover

554
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:11,021
actress for land on the third south this
at the tic tac toe board group

555
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:15,117
okay so have a group had contains things
fall

556
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:19,716
what are these things the individual
squares

557
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:22,913
but you to the squares doesn't have a
backing view to them

558
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:26,361
so I need to create some object to
represent 22 accessibility

559
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:29,857
and the way that we've done this is with
the anna's accessibility

560
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:34,206
element patty should win the slides how
you treat instanceof this in line

561
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,890
and what I've chosen to do here's
discrete a subclass a bit in another

562
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:38,143
file

563
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:42,096
so I have a subclass here

564
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:46,255
called the tic-tac-toe square
accessibility element

565
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,640
and the subclass I love and a successful
the element

566
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:53,973
has one initializer which takes a row or
column in the delegate

567
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:57,880
and has three properties a row or column
in a delegate

568
00:36:57,088 --> 00:37:00,088
the delegate method are the delegate

569
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:03,797
is just a class that can answer
questions about hey what pieces

570
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,460
are at this location on the board is the
game over is that still in progress

571
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:11,100
to cancel all the questions that this
piece is going to need

572
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,042
had to ask so have the element
representing an

573
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:20,119
mall I'm gonna pick a protocol now to
use to implement it

574
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:24,688
so what bast encapsulates what a squared
us

575
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:27,880
but when I click on it something happens
like

576
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:30,287
place my piece there I put my piece area
player great

577
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,132
Allah and elements where you click them
to interact with them and they do

578
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:35,708
something about month

579
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,623
I can conform to the accessibility
button protocol here

580
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,700
and now when I move into my
implementation file

581
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:48,416
again a buncha warnings for the items
that I need to implement

582
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,460
to the fore warnings I get here are
accessible the parent

583
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:56,098
label reform process and frame need to
be and

584
00:37:56,098 --> 00:38:01,487
important in semitic is one at a time
for or the frame

585
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:07,010
and for the parent Anderson return
whatever my super classes implementation

586
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:07,360
of

587
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:12,770
some point is we need to be sad so keep
that in mind defensible the labels a

588
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:13,146
little bit more interesting

589
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,790
and this is the description for
particular square

590
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,147
so I'm going to do ask my delegated

591
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:26,186
for hey what's the square at my row and
column and this is actually an instant

592
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:27,220
for the model

593
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:31,023
object representing a square on the
board and then

594
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:34,049
I can ask the board using one of its
class methods

595
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:38,050
was the description for the square so
this is going to return something like

596
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:41,031
this is and axe square at the top ride
turn

597
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:44,375
00 square in the centre or an empty
square at the bottom left

598
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:49,270
and a so when a land on the Salman
that's what I want to be spoken

599
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:54,115
up and in the last night the menu to
implement as accessibility perform price

600
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:59,184
so when this item is priced what should
I do while I wanna play my piece there I

601
00:38:59,319 --> 00:38:59,394
wanna play that's

602
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:04,072
where I wanna make my mark their and my
delegate knows how to play a square in a

603
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:07,480
row and column some just gonna ask it to
do that and again

604
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:13,167
return yes I handled the salon so I can
go back up to the top of my file

605
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,740
and I see that all the warnings have
gone away such great

606
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:19,663
have now a class that represents an
individual square

607
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:25,380
for accessibility that doesn't have a
backing view so now I need to go back to

608
00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:25,757
my group

609
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,190
I need to create instances up this class

610
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:32,090
to represent each square some back in my
board view

611
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:35,082
I want to say this a group house
children

612
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:39,079
views elements and the way to do that
with

613
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,618
rupi is to override the accessibility
children Mattoon

614
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:47,376
some gonna walk through

615
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,804
it looks like a lot occurred I promise
it's not gonna walk through it line by

616
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:51,970
line with the Stars

617
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,123
so the first thing is I'm

618
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:58,030
overriding accessible to children right
so I'm

619
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:01,147
the accessible to children gather and
returning an array from

620
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:05,606
and I have this I've are around so if
I've already created my children don't

621
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,970
need to create them again

622
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:11,716
if i havent I create an array to hold
all of Rd Trussville the children

623
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:17,730
and I set up two variables are many
using under my competitions

624
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:20,150
now wanting to do is create an instance
about accessibility element

625
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:24,021
for every square on the board some kinda
I'm

626
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:27,100
iterate over all the rows and all the
columns

627
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,098
and then instantiate 10 those accessible
the elements for the square

628
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,103
now remember that the parent in the
frame we're just returned as whatever

629
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,074
super classes implementation once

630
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:41,081
so I need to make sure that they're such
somewhere and that's why I'm gonna do it

631
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:43,079
here

632
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,084
so I can certainly try to build the
parent using a property and I just said

633
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,808
to myself because the parent

634
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:52,410
have a square is the board

635
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:56,092
and they need to set the frame typically
the accessibility frames

636
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:59,171
always been given in screen coordinates
and important for us because that's what

637
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:02,200
we use to draw a voice-over cursor

638
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:06,710
around a particular element I'm we were
thinking about this

639
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:09,126
with the new API in saying no be really
cool if we could just say here's my

640
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:11,042
friend

641
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:14,731
relative to my parent and they don't
have to do any work when the window

642
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:18,390
moves her my parent was around to
recalculate my frame

643
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:22,047
and screen space so we've added the
snakes convenience property to

644
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:26,072
and a successful the element as colic
sensibility freemen parent space and it

645
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:27,151
does exactly that

646
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:32,054
I can calculate the actual are tracked
that I'm using during the

647
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:36,115
for drawing and thats a given in my
parents pace

648
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:40,704
and I can suck that as the accessible
the freemen parents face and now

649
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:44,400
whenever something moves we have enough
information are on hour and

650
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:49,055
to recalculate where the frame its you
don't have to do any of that bookkeeping

651
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:52,174
so now we've created the successful the
element for each square

652
00:41:53,074 --> 00:41:57,633
you want to make sure that we at the
mall to the array in the study said

653
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,680
you want to make sure that you cash
these elements so

654
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:04,417
at any point I'll in your applications
lifetime where this

655
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:08,380
I am has been drawn on screen the
accessible the

656
00:42:08,038 --> 00:42:13,116
element representing it has to be there
for trust building to be able to query

657
00:42:14,016 --> 00:42:17,475
and then lastly remember we overrode the
gather here

658
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,140
so need to make sure re actually return
these children

659
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:26,016
so it and I can go back up to the top in
my file and I down just made this really

660
00:42:26,016 --> 00:42:27,405
complicated you I

661
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:30,990
accessible must not not much extra work

662
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:33,103
I see that all my warnings have gone
away we didn't have any warnings here

663
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:35,091
for example

664
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:39,500
but this is now added a basic level
accessibility to my app

665
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:47,319
and so let's take a look at power what
that looks like now

666
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:51,076
in the way I'm gonna verify that my
changes worked

667
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:54,875
is by using one which was pretty much in
italics us a building inspector

668
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:00,020
you can launch it from the Xcode menu
under open developer tool

669
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:03,025
an excess a building inspector

670
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:06,076
and again what this does is it shows you
the accessibility information

671
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:09,151
for the item under the mouse so here
there there's

672
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:13,095
three sections that are showing up the
very top

673
00:43:13,095 --> 00:43:17,120
is the accessibility hierarchy so if
this is analogous to scan like the view

674
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:19,161
hierarchy

675
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,700
if you're such a bill the omens are
inaccessible the hierarchy they're not

676
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:24,026
can be available to accessibility
clients

677
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:27,166
much like a view to find the view
hierarchy won't be shown

678
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:31,093
the next sections the attributes for
these are all the properties that we've

679
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:31,972
now added

680
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:37,190
onto accessible the elements and you can
see each other values

681
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:40,088
Khan and there's also some some more a
complicated ones like prime tries

682
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:41,174
attributes

683
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:45,101
so the very first thing that we worked
on was the plus or minus one

684
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:49,013
remember this was to increase and
decrease the difficulty we need to

685
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:50,017
decide to label their

686
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:53,020
has a standard app to control I'm

687
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:57,831
and I can see is that dick sucked you

688
00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:02,140
down here is showing up as decreased
difficulties this has got me know that

689
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:02,039
this

690
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:09,359
elements now labeled it's going to be
spoken when it's not gay but voice-over

691
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,119
same thing with the increased difficulty
bun

692
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,000
the label as as there which is gone

693
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,329
what about the restart game button I
remember this wasn't even available to

694
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:22,410
accessibility

695
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:26,064
and now we see that in the hierarchy is
inaccessible the button

696
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:29,141
and also has a label a restart game
disagree it's gonna be read on as a

697
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,120
restart game button

698
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:37,351
similarly with the check box it's now in
the view hierarchy which is

699
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,622
which is awesome so I'll show up to
acceptable the client's

700
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:46,520
it says that the check box it has a
label love AI opponent

701
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:50,791
and now the grid so the grid shows up as
a group

702
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:54,630
and I wanna be acceptable the proper
uses the accessible to children

703
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:57,762
and we see that has nine items and
they're all bonds

704
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:01,960
so if you take a look at just one button
it says it has i

705
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:04,144
it's in the hierarchy as well as it has
a label for its the empty top

706
00:45:05,044 --> 00:45:08,122
of next one South MT top

707
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:13,601
and to top right you'll notice here also
there's a an action section on the bond

708
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:15,210
same perform Prasanth

709
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:18,390
this is what this almond supports for
actions Sosa

710
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:22,910
that actually really great okay so now
that I've

711
00:45:22,091 --> 00:45:26,116
audited my app with excess a building
inspector I'm fairly certain that the

712
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,077
personally I've implemented

713
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:32,126
is correct so now I'm gonna turn on
voice over I'm gonna order that using

714
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,990
voice over

715
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:39,978
voice over on tic-tac-toe tic-tac-toe
window

716
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:44,890
a high pollen uncheck checkbox has
keyboard focus

717
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:48,478
great so we can now land on the element
check an opponent checkbox

718
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:52,520
I can activate it difficult decrease
difficulty

719
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:55,123
button Press Press Press decrease
difficulty

720
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:59,106
button the buns are labeled them they
support the ACF increased effect

721
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:03,305
restart game button Press restart game

722
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,630
button you can press to reset the game
if I have a game in progress

723
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:10,115
big tax tic tac toe board group I also
land on the board group

724
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:14,734
interact with tic tac toe board group
nine items

725
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:18,720
empty top left button and I can move
into the script to see the different

726
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:18,138
power

727
00:46:19,038 --> 00:46:23,090
peace and the top button now by place
apiece they're using activate options

728
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:26,618
Press ext top button MD top left button

729
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:30,561
Press X top left button I'm so over of

730
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:35,052
I can play a full game of tic-tac-toe
now this is really exciting and I hope

731
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:35,343
you seen that

732
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:39,660
was just a few lines of code which
really walk you through what you need to

733
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:39,104
do that

734
00:46:40,004 --> 00:46:43,083
add accessibility to something something
like this

735
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,135
and I hope you really see that the level
the castle is quite drastic

736
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:51,363
before there's hardly any in and now
there's on us for support

737
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:55,430
so there's a couple more things that you
can do here

738
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:59,074
to make this app even more excitable
Minister point out one

739
00:46:59,074 --> 00:47:02,088
suppose for example that I'm playing
this game with

740
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:06,124
a a user who is using voice over and
they're on the check box

741
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:11,403
focuses on the check box they can
activity I am using

742
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:17,210
Command Option space but I can also go
in and click the checkbox with my maps

743
00:47:17,021 --> 00:47:21,180
so how does a voice-over user know if
I've change the state of something

744
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:25,412
out from underneath them while we solve
this problem using accessibility

745
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:26,800
notifications

746
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:31,660
and this has been some questions about
which ones do I use wonder I use than

747
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:34,775
and we really tried to answer that with
the new protocols file

748
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:39,410
so again this is your one-stop shop and
you can really go back there

749
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:42,123
and here in the check box protocol
declaration there's a comment which

750
00:47:43,023 --> 00:47:45,902
tells me about the notifications on you
to post

751
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:50,130
son this case it sells the accessibility
value change notification

752
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,450
needs to be posted whenever the
accessibility value changes

753
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:56,069
recall that search act or unchecked
state

754
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:59,075
so for any point changes for any reason
I need her

755
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:02,104
are some this notification as really
easy to do

756
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:08,073
min go back to my check box you if you
recall we had the title track stay and

757
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:08,750
missus

758
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:12,094
work on activated when used the
accessibility activate action

759
00:48:12,094 --> 00:48:15,149
and here's where need to push the
notification I can be there with

760
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:19,092
and its accessibility post notification

761
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:23,521
the element this notification should be
associated with us the check box itself

762
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,790
and the notification type as an annus
accessibility

763
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,658
value change notification at a

764
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:35,435
so again from the more advanced
accessible via items now

765
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:39,210
done actually take that much more code
you there

766
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:42,052
and so now if you were to run the shop
again and your clobbering with the

767
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,621
voiceover use on you click to bun

768
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:48,480
there now be announced the new state
will now be announced to them

769
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:51,397
so that's the end that the demo now and
I hope what you've seen is that we've

770
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:52,910
tried to make it

771
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:56,122
as easy as possible for you

772
00:48:57,022 --> 00:49:00,063
out accessibility with our new API

773
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:03,482
I should also mention dad we have

774
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:07,127
a sample app you may have seen from
Patna college you accessible DUI

775
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:08,980
examples

776
00:49:08,098 --> 00:49:11,967
and what it is is a collection are all
different types of elements

777
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,540
so here there's a button taxed images

778
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:19,088
we also have more complicated you I like
layout areas

779
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:22,166
collapsible outline views people views
and what we've done

780
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:26,150
is implemented you should use using
different methods so for example

781
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,072
subclassing from a standard app controls
making and

782
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:35,094
a subclass a tentative you but also Open
GL CA layers we have examples for all

783
00:49:35,094 --> 00:49:36,213
those

784
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:40,110
and for this release we've gone through
ripped out the excess ability that we

785
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:41,270
had

786
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:45,586
and additive right back in with the new
API and what we found was a drastic

787
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:48,922
code savings many many fewer lines of
code

788
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:53,786
and we hope to do is have this available
as a reference for you say hey I want

789
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:55,107
learn how to use this protocol

790
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:58,950
you have an example on a concrete
implementation I we've done

791
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:01,102
this is available along with the
tic-tac-toe app on developer dot dot dot

792
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:02,129
dot com

793
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:06,798
today please go check it out download it
we also have

794
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:10,500
in this particular example a nice read
me file the house

795
00:50:10,005 --> 00:50:15,844
have a developer quick start on how to
use our API

796
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:20,890
so with an and summary really took this
release to think about

797
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:24,568
how can we make it easier to
accessibility to your application

798
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:30,442
and what we came away with was a
brand-new really easy to use API

799
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:34,730
and is really easy to use because all
the accessible the attributes

800
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:37,171
are now property is on the object for
the really easy to set up

801
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:41,095
house at the trouble the protocols which
guide you through

802
00:50:41,095 --> 00:50:44,168
the items that you need to implement in
order to meet your custom

803
00:50:45,068 --> 00:50:49,164
you I a trustable and then lastly we
formalize the four you own a cloth

804
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:53,068
into an a successful the element and
there for you

805
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:57,117
to be accessible the backin object when
there's no UI view 4 and her an issue

806
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:00,021
back in

807
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:03,870
would like to encourage you to test with
voice over it ships with every Mac

808
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:08,040
and its a great way for you to see what
our customers are going to experience

809
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:11,039
using assistive technology with your
application

810
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,048
if you'd like to just an empty bag a
little bit more

811
00:51:14,048 --> 00:51:17,847
we have accessible inspector there to
really getting at what exactly is going

812
00:51:18,279 --> 00:51:19,160
on with your

813
00:51:19,016 --> 00:51:22,016
accessibility element and lastly

814
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:25,020
we want to support you in this
transition to the new API

815
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:28,921
we really want to contribute encourage
you to use it and so we built is really

816
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,180
great developer examples that we've been

817
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:34,018
that we've now released and we hope you
can use as a reference

818
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:37,937
cash for your implementation

819
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:41,142
