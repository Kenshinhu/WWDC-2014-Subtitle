1
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:14,072
morning

2
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:19,971
either

3
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,720
welcome the session 704

4
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:26,163
building aP's for enterprise and
education my name is David harjo

5
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:30,069
I'm a software developer and I West and
today I'll be joint

6
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:34,051
I'll by Alex Parkin who also works with
me

7
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:40,068
on I S device management so

8
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:45,147
building aP's for the enterprise and for
the education market

9
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,055
really is not that much different from

10
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:53,108
building aP's in the App Store right
you've got a cap a nap you gotta get an

11
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:58,197
app that solves the problem you have to
have a nap

12
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:03,890
that is well design and it's gotta be a
pleasure to use

13
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,208
for the user but in an enterprise

14
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:14,063
you've got some unique requirements
usually your clients devices are very

15
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:15,100
likely

16
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:20,093
going to be manage under mobile device
management these devices may be

17
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:21,991
supervised

18
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,880
and if you're not familiar with what
supervise means we'll talk about that in

19
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:24,130
a minute

20
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:31,026
and they may be special use cases that
are kinda peculiar to the business and

21
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:32,064
education market

22
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:35,122
so today what I'm gonna out present to
you

23
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:41,047
is some tips and tricks to help you to
write your next enterprise

24
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:44,092
and education aP's I'll so that their

25
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:47,161
done much more pleasurable to use and
makes you a much better

26
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:54,076
developer in this field so let's get
started by talking about

27
00:01:54,076 --> 00:02:00,103
mobile device management so

28
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:06,015
what's mobile device management mobile
device management

29
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:09,604
is a protocol that's built into OS and
OS 10

30
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,500
that allows a server

31
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:20,005
to remotely manage that device a server
that's managing a device using MDM

32
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,640
can install network access such as VPN

33
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:29,423
or WiFi it can install celts

34
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,560
such as email calendar contacts and so
forth

35
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:37,325
a new NIOS 8 they can now install books

36
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,878
such as PDF's he pops and iBooks offer

37
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,340
as well as books from the iBookstore and
manage them

38
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:48,601
they can install single fine on

39
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,276
using Kerberos and in New NIOS

40
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,480
8 Kerberos can now use and identity
certificate

41
00:02:56,048 --> 00:03:00,677
so that their identity can be renewed
without the user ever having to type in

42
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:08,109
a password and most important to you

43
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:13,557
today an MDM server

44
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:18,650
can install and configure your app's so
this is very important

45
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,074
and here's your first trip for

46
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,180
today allow MDM to configure your app's

47
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:29,307
and we'll talk about how that can be
done

48
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:36,469
exactly in a few minutes so little
device management let's talk a few

49
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:39,652
minutes

50
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,955
about manage aP's and accounts so this
iz

51
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,900
little bit of a terminology that we have

52
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:50,438
anything that MDM installs

53
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,378
on i OS we call managed

54
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,826
these include everything that you saw
from the last slide

55
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,591
manage aP's managed accounts and I was 8

56
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,248
as you know you can install third-party
keyboard extensions the way you install

57
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,225
third-party keyword extensions

58
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:16,220
on Iowa State if you can't spell is gone
ap that has an extension and

59
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,721
if that app was installed using MDM

60
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,966
that keyboard extension s then
considered as manager as well

61
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,398
and of course

62
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,720
in Iowa State we have this great new
feature call

63
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:36,074
document providers thank you

64
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:39,081
it's a really powerful feature and

65
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:42,117
if you install an app that happens to
vend

66
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:46,018
document provider extension

67
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,062
such asan ap like give access to your
internet

68
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:52,091
your intranet resources or your

69
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,134
your network file storage that app

70
00:04:56,034 --> 00:05:00,071
also becomes quote-unquote managed

71
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,085
so this is in contrast with things that
the user install themselves

72
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:08,114
sold if the user goes out and installed
app from the App Store

73
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:12,098
on their own BYOD device for example
those things are

74
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:15,114
considered not manage so

75
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:19,027
we have managed switches the stuff that
and %um installed

76
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,098
and you have not managed which is what
the user installs

77
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:25,132
I so why do we do this

78
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:29,054
well it helps I O S

79
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:33,151
to restrict dataflow so that your
enterprise data

80
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:38,149
doesn't flow into your users data space
and vice versa

81
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:44,052
so for example if you are in Manish at

82
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:48,061
and you are looking at a document and
you cap open in

83
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:52,074
you know that list app that shows up on
the bottom of your screen

84
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:56,074
his all the app that can handle that
document

85
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:59,170
I that mister aP's will be filtered down

86
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:03,088
so that because you start from a managed
ap only other managed aP's

87
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:07,116
and and accounts will show up in that
list

88
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,055
and we do this automatically

89
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,056
conversely when you are in

90
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:17,059
on unmanaged ap I

91
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:21,152
and you tap open in the list of gaps
that you see

92
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:26,114
will not include manage that so in that
way

93
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:30,071
without the user ever having to do any
switching off

94
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:33,134
you know work and home I

95
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:38,068
we protect your data and we do this
everywhere

96
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:41,092
emails so you can't Fort a corporate
email using

97
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:45,092
dry cloth account for example we do it
in calendars

98
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:48,160
in attachments we do it a in Iowa State

99
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:53,007
we have managed remains in Safari so if
you specify

100
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:56,061
certain domains in Safari as belonging
to your corporate

101
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:01,119
intranet documents that you download
from those domains

102
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:05,108
will only going to manage that

103
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:13,008
XF

104
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:19,042
and manage aP's get access to per app
VPN

105
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:24,077
this is a feature with happen sigh I O S
seven and has proven very popular

106
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,102
a and what this is just a review

107
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:31,010
is that Manish capsule get that data

108
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:34,290
tunnel through this VPN but not anything
else

109
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,120
not the user's data so your VPN

110
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:41,020
carries your data and not the user's
data

111
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:47,003
yet another way two separate enterprise
and personal data

112
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:51,023
so what's the takeaway rely on I O S

113
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,115
to manage the dataflow between aP's

114
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:58,050
and accounts don't try to do it yourself

115
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:01,078
I O S has a great way of allowing this
to happen

116
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,034
in a very clean and intuitive way

117
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:09,111
using the fact that you're managing a
device over India

118
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:17,011
right so that them

119
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:24,164
next let's talk about supervise devices

120
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:29,130
so what's this a supervised device

121
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:34,172
is a device that has been activated into
you know so supervision

122
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,630
it is it health I O S that the device

123
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:42,099
is owned by the enterprise this is in
contrast to a device that owned by a

124
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,156
user such as bring your own device

125
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:48,122
right supervision can only be set

126
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:53,691
activation there are two ways to step
back to us supervision

127
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,290
reactivation the first way and

128
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,808
you sought you saw this in the keynote
yesterday iOS device and rolling

129
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,870
programme

130
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:06,104
with DP a devices that your enterprise

131
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:11,012
purchased from Apple I can be configured

132
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:14,012
so that they're supervised and enrolled
into your MDM

133
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:18,041
right out of the box you don't have to
touch it at all

134
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,720
you Hannah shrink wrap up to the end
user the on boxer

135
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:28,072
you walk through the the Setup Assistant
and they're supervised and enrolled

136
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,066
the second way is Apple configurator
which requires you to take the device

137
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:33,402
out

138
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,290
and plug it into USB depending on your

139
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:43,628
I use case in your scenarios wanna be
should serve any

140
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:48,040
so why do we supervise devices

141
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,963
well tell you why you can access the
whole bunch of different

142
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:55,350
restrictions and controls that we only
allow

143
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:58,454
I on enterprise own devices

144
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:05,769
such as always on VPN new in Iowa State

145
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,290
global GDP proxy Third Party Content
Filter

146
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,518
also new and Iowa State

147
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,160
single app mod which lock your device
into a single ap

148
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:22,042
perfect for kiosks

149
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:25,081
I'll will see some examples of that
later

150
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,540
we've got restriction to prevent the
user from erasing their own device

151
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,490
anyone with students here

152
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:38,458
and preventing enabling restrictions
also students

153
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,960
your local you your settings and many
more

154
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,535
so the takeaway here as: police
supervisor

155
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,788
enterprise on devices if you own it

156
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,600
supervisor you won't regret it

157
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:57,275
okay

158
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:01,670
so for the next

159
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:05,106
part of our presentation

160
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:08,775
I'll we're gonna show you some example
aP's

161
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,402
that may illustrate

162
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:15,850
some of the use cases you may face

163
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:20,099
when developing aP's for the enterprise

164
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:24,123
the first ap we're gonna show you is a
document access ap

165
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:28,092
and this ap is I designed

166
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:34,261
to access a secure document like a
sensitive documents

167
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,970
may be over your intranet and stored on
the device in a secure

168
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:42,196
matter

169
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,110
the second app that we're gonna see is a
point-of-sale

170
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:49,092
ap this may be something like you use

171
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:52,501
in a retail store to check out customers

172
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,391
you know buying items and the third

173
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,670
will be something that education may use
an assessment ap

174
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:03,105
where the student uses your app

175
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:08,079
to take exams rice 03 example ap

176
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,738
document access point-of-sale an
assessment

177
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:17,490
and along the way I we will illustrate
some of the things that we

178
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:20,067
we talked about earlier

179
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:25,130
so let's start with the first ap

180
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:31,039
k secure document access

181
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:35,149
again this ap a retrieved documents
securely

182
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:42,688
and displays it to the end user

183
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,161
alright so let's talk a little bit

184
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:51,472
about MDM ap configuration

185
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,681
so you remember a few minutes ago I
talked about

186
00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:00,785
allowing an MDM server to configure your
app's

187
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,300
well how do you do this

188
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:08,212
it's really very simple all you have to
do

189
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,551
is to watch for the special key in Ennis
user defaults

190
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:16,110
com dot Apple da configuration

191
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,600
don't manage when you read this key

192
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,732
from Uranus user defaults you get a
dictionary

193
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,066
that magically appears when the MDM
server

194
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,470
pushes configuration doubt your so the
MDM server

195
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:34,110
pushes down a dictionary and you can
access it

196
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:38,180
using this key

197
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,313
your app can then respond to
configuration changes

198
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:47,619
so why do you want to do this well

199
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,665
what's the first thing that you wanna do
when you install an app

200
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,085
you want to configure its URL probably

201
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,195
had some server I am you may have a nap

202
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,736
that this deployed in more than one
branch

203
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:06,082
of your business and you want to
configure it

204
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,210
for that particular location

205
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,311
instead of having the end-user
reconstructions

206
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:16,553
and say all pappas and perhaps that go
here go there

207
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:21,032
type this URL in what could go wrong

208
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,779
you define your own keys and

209
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,790
say hey a if you

210
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,428
install my app over MDM push down his
keys

211
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:37,144
and I'll see them and I'll use them for
my app without any user intervention

212
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,850
right at configuration so

213
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:46,167
you are also great so in this example
you gonna do some your URL configuration

214
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,122
and AST I'll trust that list of

215
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,381
server root certificates it's also very
important I

216
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:58,605
it helps you to prevent man in the
middle attacks

217
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,883
and I will show you how to do that in an
example in the code examples

218
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,303
so I am I were asked Alex to come up
here

219
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,920
and is gonna show you a little code
example

220
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:16,097
that demonstrates MDM configuration

221
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:19,466
good morning developers so we're going
to switch

222
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,370
over to our down a laptop going to look
at some comps

223
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,710
SAR first application that we're looking
at today is our secure document access

224
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,345
app which we've called secretive

225
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,215
in our example so with MDM afton
figuration

226
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,130
the most important thing that you need
to do is to make sure that you register

227
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,644
for the NS users did user defaults to
change notification

228
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:48,188
this is the notification that will be
sent out when an MDM after figuration

229
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,637
is pushed down to your device see you
need to be listening to this

230
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:55,507
notification and then rereading the
default when you receive it

231
00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,218
so in our example I have a few troller
when the big stroller leads I'm going to

232
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,300
register for this notification

233
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,720
am every time I received a I'm going to
call re default value so that I can

234
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:10,661
get my values back again an in this
example on going to load up

235
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:15,371
re default values as soon as I get the
view up so that I can get the first

236
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:19,350
initial lead so in my example here

237
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:22,814
so you remember we talked about that
Honda Apple dock configuration dot

238
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,160
manage key

239
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,925
this is the key in NS user defaults for
we're going to be stuffing BNF

240
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,165
dictionary

241
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,120
with your configuration and sell your
notice that

242
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:36,947
suggested some other keys here on in my
dictionary I'm going to have a key which

243
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:37,850
has a string

244
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:41,484
for my server URL which is going to be
the URL for the document I'm going to be

245
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,263
retrieving

246
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,452
and your awesomeness that I have to keep
or configure a for a server

247
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,470
root certificate we're get to this later
in the presentation

248
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:54,111
but that also one going to be pushing
down in this and your map configuration

249
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:59,400
and so you know simply default all I do
is I call on tennis user defaults

250
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,542
I make sure I call into that
configuration key

251
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,100
and then from the dictionary I pull out
the relevant

252
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:09,003
on information I need such as the server
euro

253
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:12,077
an important thing to know is do you put
error checking on this

254
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:15,516
make sure they are not loading bad
values

255
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:21,270
and sell was now what we're doing is all
switch over to the iPad not push down

256
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,560
an example MDM at configuration sup

257
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:28,097
you nurse at my AppleCare called secret
I secretive

258
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:32,184
and when I open it up I don't have an
MDM ap configuration

259
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,137
here currently I've installed the match
dapper you right now I don't have my

260
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:37,128
server URL

261
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:43,089
sup over on my MDM server I've loaded up
a command to send down

262
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:46,123
the match.com om and ap configuration

263
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:50,047
sa mga send that notification down

264
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:53,088
and you notice that we when I received
the notification for and this user

265
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,119
defaults to change

266
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,107
on a Mac we've started up a session and
retrieve this document from the server

267
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:00,060
you're all that was given

268
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:05,012
and so that as MDM ap figuration and
were returned to their

269
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:09,137
thanks Alex

270
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:13,085
it's like magic your app to configure

271
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:16,138
correctly without having your user do
anything

272
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,056
it's Corey I hope you caught that little
the

273
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:25,108
remarked that Alex made please validate
the input that you get

274
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:30,089
from the server because as far as you
are concerned as an ap writer

275
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:33,123
the server isn't unknown network and the
T

276
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:37,074
and they're gonna be pushing down keys
that maybe miss format it

277
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,145
or of the wrong type up so please
validate

278
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:44,050
the keys make sure that your I
understand what they are

279
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,123
also publish what you understand so that
the server

280
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:52,098
that means can configure you correctly

281
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:55,151
so that's MDM configuration

282
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,089
next alright

283
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,158
let's talk about single sign

284
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,126
on a single sign-on

285
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:10,081
is I Baker Bros we have operate Kerber
single sign-on

286
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:13,090
on I West that can be applied

287
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,078
by the MDM server across the entire
system

288
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,123
so that once you login a

289
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:25,100
you'll be logged in across several
different aP's

290
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,005
when you're accessing the same network

291
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:33,073
resource so using single sign-on

292
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:37,118
couldn't be easier are you just have to
use

293
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:42,076
HTTP or HTTPS which most of you probably
are

294
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:46,083
if you use Ennis euro connection or an
issue oral session

295
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:50,053
Kerber a single fine on is free for you

296
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:55,034
so here's the takeaway don't do anything

297
00:19:55,034 --> 00:20:00,060
in and it works it's great the MDM
server

298
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:04,064
will apply the configuration and your
caps will either get a £200 okay

299
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:09,030
or a 401 fail it was a 2-under okay

300
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:12,080
assume that the resources available to
you

301
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:16,063
and just use of course

302
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:19,148
your aP's may provide alternate

303
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:23,134
authentication such as you know HTTP
digest

304
00:20:24,034 --> 00:20:27,112
I and Kerberos authentication

305
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:31,081
will be attempt at first and if that
doesn't work

306
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,108
I A West will fall back to reporting an
error to your ap

307
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:38,043
and you get the chance to authenticate
using

308
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:42,046
a difference scheme so

309
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:49,046
don't do anything no example next okay

310
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:54,121
here's something that a that with gotten

311
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:59,030
asked several times how do i download

312
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:02,068
files securely all the way from my
server

313
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:07,108
down to the flash on IRS I

314
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:12,069
was s you may or may not know all files
that you create

315
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:15,138
from your app already get this I'll

316
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:21,084
protection level protection complete
until

317
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,123
first user authentication so just a
recap

318
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:29,026
this means that the file is a cryptid I

319
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:32,088
unreadable after you restart your IRS
device

320
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:35,172
once you enter your passcode the device

321
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:40,085
the file is readable and it remains
readable

322
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:43,104
across device lock until

323
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:47,082
you restart the device again so

324
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:50,091
what we wanna do is we want to upgrade
the

325
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,179
this file so if you do nothing and you
use you're just writer file to disk

326
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,163
this is what you gonna get but we won a
great that so we want to have

327
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:05,129
I the file be a specify test data
protection complete which means that

328
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,104
whenever you lock the device

329
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:11,006
the file because unreadable
cryptographically

330
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:14,033
and with the next time the user

331
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,096
enters the passcode but have the file
because readable again

332
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:20,137
et cetera so

333
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:24,049
we're gonna use an issue oral sessions

334
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:27,122
data task to do this and

335
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:32,043
as a little a bonus years old maybe this
document is extra sensitive

336
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:35,058
I you don't want this document to appear

337
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:38,060
in your users backup so

338
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:41,103
I called back up or iTunes backup so
we're gonna show you

339
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:45,090
how to mark files so that they don't get

340
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:48,058
backed up alright so let such or back to
Alex

341
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,044
and is gonna show you some code to do
this so

342
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:58,094
back on our demo machine your notice
that we have on our view controller said

343
00:22:58,094 --> 00:22:58,152
it as

344
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:02,098
implementing the delegates %uh NS you're
all session

345
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:05,174
and and that's your obsession data and
the reason we've done this is we're

346
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:06,147
going to

347
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:10,052
over we're going to use as Stella get
call backs during

348
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:15,165
our secure download cell down here in
secure your /url session that I have set

349
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:16,137
up here

350
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,070
I'm going to take that use server you're
around I pull down from

351
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:24,059
MDM ap configuration I'm going to create
an and that's your all session

352
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:29,107
data task right here you notice that
left the completion handler at the nail

353
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:33,065
and the reason I've done this is by
setting now for the completion handler

354
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:36,163
I will get the don't get call backs for
the day to task

355
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:40,065
and that's the most important thing for
me sup

356
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:44,080
in URL session data task did receive
response

357
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:47,045
I'm going to get this call as soon as we
make the connection and I'm going to

358
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:48,075
create

359
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:52,141
a file where I'm going to download Mike
strategic plan pdf

360
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,098
and sound your nurse I call NS File
Manager default manager

361
00:23:56,098 --> 00:23:59,102
create file path contents and
attributes:

362
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:04,023
and the attribute I'm going to pass into
it is this and that's file protection P

363
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:07,041
and in that and a spa me I'm going to
specify that

364
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:11,072
I want and a fire protection complete
myself and what this means is that the

365
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:11,148
file will be

366
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:15,140
unreadable when the device is locked in
left the files already

367
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:19,089
ok them when the by when the device
walks and so while I'm downloading

368
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,028
I'm going to set the attribute to that
and sell

369
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,061
the other important thing that we
mentioned already is that we want to

370
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,078
turn off

371
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:31,133
on file backup and so why I'm going to
do is I'm going to sell onto the file

372
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:33,052
URL

373
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:36,055
up resource value and resource mana the
key

374
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:40,111
I'm going to set it on in is and this
URL is excluded from backup key

375
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:45,034
and this key will make it so that this
file will not be backed up in iTunes

376
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:48,089
or and I clout and so were gone on

377
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:51,171
inurl session data task then received a
net this delegate math is gonna be

378
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:53,099
called every time urge the

379
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:57,140
new data from my server I'm just going
to store all into that file

380
00:24:58,004 --> 00:25:02,058
I create earlier and then at the very
end in your all session

381
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:05,141
testing complete welfare I'm gonna make
sure there are no errors in

382
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:09,135
if there were no errors I'm going to
then change it so that the attribute for

383
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:11,068
an s5 texan key

384
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:14,134
is changed to complete because at this
point I decided you know when the device

385
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:16,103
locked I want this file to be

386
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:20,030
unreadable and was it that's

387
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:24,025
pretty much it arm I would show you the
demo but we've already shown you that an

388
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:24,128
MDM ap

389
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:30,106
the rations them let's go back to Dave
thanks Alex

390
00:25:31,006 --> 00:25:34,098
so downloading to a secure file here's
how you do it

391
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:38,150
you create an issue oral session create
a file

392
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:42,050
when when the request begins create a
file with

393
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:45,098
data protection complete unless open

394
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:49,048
so that you can continue to write data
to that file

395
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,121
after downloading it even if the device
is locked

396
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:57,046
when the file has completely downloaded
upgrade their protection

397
00:25:57,046 --> 00:26:00,105
to file protection complete and up

398
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:04,024
as you can tell third as you can see
there's an in a swirl method you can

399
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:05,027
call

400
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:08,070
to Sep a bit that says don't back up
this file

401
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:11,026
to iTunes and I clout

402
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:14,140
alright next

403
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:18,013
HTTPS certificate pending

404
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,050
so I we all know that

405
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:24,063
HTTPS is a way for the client to tell

406
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:28,047
weathers talking to the correct server

407
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:31,130
I'll this only works if the certificate
chain

408
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:37,050
is trustworthy so one of the things that
we usually do

409
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:41,086
s Wiese we can specify for this
connection

410
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:45,091
that only the certificates are to be
trusted and not any other certificate in

411
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:45,178
your database

412
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:50,116
that make otherwise we trust the Ford
for example Safari

413
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:56,039
I and to do this of course you meters to
the PS

414
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,075
you need to specify York trusted root
certificates

415
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,119
during HTTPS authentication

416
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:07,034
you'd and you do this to prevent man in
the middle attacks

417
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:10,040
that pretend to be your server

418
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:13,186
and here's to take away you certificate
pinning

419
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:19,095
instead of doing things like SSID
detection

420
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,132
especially in you know like retail a
scenarios

421
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:26,056
lot of people use SSID or some

422
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:29,080
other kind of your respect to tell
whether or not there you know they're in

423
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:29,033
there

424
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:34,012
you know talking to the correct server
instead of doing that

425
00:27:34,012 --> 00:27:37,015
make sure you are talking through the
correct server regardless

426
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:40,083
of the environment that you're in

427
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,171
alright to show you a short example of
how we do certificate pinning

428
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:48,132
let's switch back to the to alexander's
code

429
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:52,039
sell your will remember that I mention
that we had that

430
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,105
root certificate key that I set so when
I push down the MDM

431
00:27:56,005 --> 00:28:00,036
ap configuration I push down the data
for my server's root certificate

432
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:03,053
because I want to check to make sure
that are not connecting to the wrong

433
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:03,127
server

434
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:08,060
and verify that my users are connecting
to the server I want them to you

435
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:13,019
so journalists that I have here MFN that
employees called you are session

436
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:16,127
they receive challenge with completion
handler and this is going to be call

437
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:18,060
when I try and connect to my

438
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:21,061
HTTP ass server and when I try and
connect

439
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:25,100
I want to double check that the
authentication method that was

440
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,086
in the challenges protection space is
and that's your all

441
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:32,089
authentication method server trap if
cell

442
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,106
I'm going to get the sack truss raft
from the server

443
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:40,034
which is in challenge that protection
space that server trust

444
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:43,081
and then the next thing I'm going to do
is under load up that root certificate

445
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:47,116
I got from india Mac figuration I'm in
this example I've already loaded that

446
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:48,102
why did they

447
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:52,055
and its user defaults re back I put into
a variable called self

448
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:56,083
that into server root certificate data
some girl up that data

449
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:59,167
and I'm going to create a sec
certificate with their and I want double

450
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,165
check that the certificate was create
correctly by making sure that's not

451
00:29:03,065 --> 00:29:03,140
normal

452
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:08,041
and if so I'm going to then that be
anchor certificates

453
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:11,112
on the servers challenge trust that I
got

454
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:15,015
and resided this is I wanna make sure
that I

455
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:18,029
only trust the research I've got sent
down I don't want to trust

456
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:22,115
any ob the default search it gets there
included in the eye West bikes

457
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:26,061
and by saying the route anger
certificates I can extend them

458
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:29,086
you know side call also have this method
Sectra set

459
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:33,104
anchor certificates only if I wanted to
make it so that I also trust that the

460
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:36,011
fault certificates installed on the vice

461
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:39,060
I would set this yes value at the end to
now

462
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:42,585
arm if you are only selling it for the
incur certificates

463
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:47,340
that you trust you do not have to set
this avoid I in this example show you

464
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:47,106
how you can

465
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:51,065
trust the device assertive gets if you
want you and sell

466
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:55,074
the last thing that I'm going to do is
I'm going to do a sec trust evaluate

467
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:58,145
with the servers challenge trust and I'm
going to get Russ resulting from that

468
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,063
transfers on I'm going to make sure that
you know

469
00:30:01,063 --> 00:30:05,095
I didn't receive any errors and make
sure that the sect Russ result is your

470
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:05,187
unspecified

471
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:11,160
or Percy on and then if I find out that
I do trust the certificate or five

472
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:13,087
turned off certificate pending

473
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:17,107
I'm going to I'm actually just say camp
call the completion handler

474
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:21,010
with and this year all session of
challenge use credential and give it the

475
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:23,058
green ensured that the server gave me

476
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:27,146
if I don't trust the surgeon get I will
call once their completion handler

477
00:30:28,046 --> 00:30:31,114
and this year all session of challenge
reject protection space

478
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:36,038
and that will tell the app that no I'm
not going to allow you to download

479
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:40,132
sup in our example on were go back to
the iPad again

480
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:46,046
sup you know Safari download this file
in settings upset up the lair

481
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:49,072
can hear concert if company and I'm
gonna turn in on

482
00:30:49,072 --> 00:30:52,094
this and the next thing I'm good to you
and

483
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:56,099
a right mess want you there so let me
just reset this

484
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,188
sup when I call into the a

485
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:03,887
yeah sup your nurse ignore the crash

486
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,820
I this when I called back into the app
it tried to load up the document again

487
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:13,089
from server and your notice that it's
telling me that my certificate

488
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:16,166
can buy the server the certificate
presented by the server is not say as my

489
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,078
concert at get

490
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:22,120
so let me go back to my server and I'm
going to change it so that it presents

491
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:26,004
right certificate

492
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:29,070
cell have set up my server at pics the
certificate

493
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:33,050
everything's getting I'm going to click
on my refresh

494
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:37,062
and wiry fresh as Penn certificate was
cracked this

495
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,220
comments I was able to lead the document
and so that is how you use a kit kat

496
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:46,075
dennings

497
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:49,098
thanks Alex issue TPS certificate

498
00:31:49,098 --> 00:31:54,132
pinning I assures you that there's no
man in the middle attack

499
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:59,064
with the connection for your trusted
server

500
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:02,080
so what we have we learned from the
first example

501
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:06,050
ap the document secure document viewer

502
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:10,056
I'll be learned ever that MDM ap
configuration

503
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:13,128
is awesome right magical

504
00:32:14,028 --> 00:32:17,082
server can configure your app's just
right

505
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:21,089
the user doesn't have to do it and you
can offer keys

506
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:25,060
to the server admin to configure up

507
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:28,011
at to set up your ap just the way they
like it and by the way

508
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:32,017
at configuration can be delivered

509
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:35,031
ass you're installing the app so there's
no race

510
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:39,072
between app installation and
configuration

511
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:42,095
I'll we also learned that single sign-on

512
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:45,187
is also awesome because you don't have
to do anything

513
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:49,130
and it works all you have to do is use
HTTP

514
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:54,052
osha TPS and if you if you're administer
configured

515
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,968
single fine on on the device then it
will just work

516
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,880
or you'll get an of failure

517
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:05,101
we learn how to download files securely

518
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:10,007
using an issue oral session day the task
and setting

519
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:13,046
the correct protection level at
different parts of the download

520
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:16,098
as well as excluding from backup an of
course

521
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:19,123
we saw how to pin are HTTPS

522
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:26,038
certificates that's our first

523
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,038
alright next ap point-of-sale

524
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:33,132
for this example we are going to show
you a little

525
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:37,128
I maybe a device that a sales associate

526
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:42,073
might carry so we have a scanner on the
left-hand side here in the cab are

527
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:45,082
which will scan barcodes and we have a
catalog

528
00:33:46,063 --> 00:33:49,160
that left them look up prices for
products that are

529
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:53,025
peebles so

530
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,091
the first thing i wanna talk to you
about is

531
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:59,134
sale at mod so single at mod

532
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:03,039
is a wave that MDM server

533
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:07,171
can't lock the device into just your

534
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:11,125
you can sent a command down and

535
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:15,030
tell the device just run this app if the
app crashes

536
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:18,062
relaunch as the app the user press the
home button

537
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:22,091
just got stuck in the a so that's on
some level will show that later

538
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:26,127
in a in a letter example but first

539
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:30,060
I'd like to talk about I beacon

540
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:33,265
so ID can I beacons awesome

541
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:37,550
it gives you context it tells your
device

542
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:40,060
attend a culture ap that you're near
something

543
00:34:40,006 --> 00:34:43,072
right you something that you specify

544
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:49,145
up so you can use ID can to provide your
app with context

545
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,390
in this case for the point of sale at we
want to provide the app

546
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,102
the knowledge that you are actually
using barcode scanner

547
00:34:57,002 --> 00:35:00,009
near the checkout register right so you
take the device

548
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:03,093
elsewhere I it what you do will not
allow you to scan

549
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:06,158
prices at the scan barker's

550
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:11,145
so using I V can in conjunction with
other car location technologies

551
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:15,102
such Justin or GPS location gives you a
relief

552
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:20,005
fine-grained control over how your ap
used

553
00:35:20,005 --> 00:35:23,022
I and it gives you an ability

554
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:28,029
using Indian ap configuration to let the
admins configure at your app's

555
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:31,098
so that your racket only be used in this
particular retail store

556
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:35,057
or in that particular contact right

557
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:38,063
so here's a tip use I beacon to verify

558
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:42,102
your location sensitive operation

559
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:49,048
so I'm gonna head of out again and is
gonna show you a little example

560
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:53,114
so for our point-of-sale ap I have
letter app called Miller

561
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:57,108
which is for selling baby clothes and
sell in my example

562
00:35:58,008 --> 00:36:01,017
why I have is I have this app does again
this after we get I'm going to create

563
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:05,163
a CL location manager object and I'm
going to set the app delegate

564
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,522
add the deli up for the location manager
om

565
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:14,310
in the important thing for the IB chem
where we're going to this method here

566
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:18,095
a star Mark for redshirt began as that
what I need to use I need to set up an

567
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:21,110
and thats UUID for the region that I
want

568
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:26,092
this work in and so I might sample let's
imagine our point-of-sale example that

569
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,069
we have we want are

570
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:31,112
people at the red shirt to be you know
in a general area we don't want them in

571
00:36:32,012 --> 00:36:34,027
the back room scanning things and
selling

572
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:37,030
things without the speaker security
cameras around them

573
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:40,846
so for our region I'm going to create
you ID specified here

574
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,384
and I'm going to give an identify your
for have the app some

575
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:48,230
line this case and decree feel beacon
region

576
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:51,066
using the proximity you idea created and
the I don't fire

577
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:54,158
and I'm going to call on to the location
matter to start monitoring

578
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:59,121
for this region answer why the important
things that you need to make sure you

579
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:00,078
implement

580
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:04,078
is this method I've location manager did
determine stay

581
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:07,097
for region this method will be called
when your app

582
00:37:07,097 --> 00:37:11,172
is not is in the background so that your
app can receive region notification

583
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:13,168
changes so that say you now

584
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:17,164
they close my register ap they walked
out the store and then they open

585
00:37:18,064 --> 00:37:21,098
I'm walked out store you will get and no
you will

586
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:24,193
receive this met they call back when
they leave the region

587
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:29,502
and so in this example I'm just going to
you I have it so that when you are

588
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,190
inside the Beacon region

589
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,025
I want to start figuring out how far
away they are from the IP can cause I

590
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,172
wanna make sure that my cashiers

591
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:40,097
are right closely BB can I don't want
them you know

592
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:43,141
all the way on the other side the store
South I'm gonna start

593
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:47,110
range in the beacons in the region and
why the things I'm gonna do some good

594
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,015
implement this method

595
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:52,093
I've location manager did range begins
in region

596
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:55,140
and I'm just going to get the closest
pecan cuz I don't particularly care

597
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:59,047
about which I begin their quest
hairstyles are close to one

598
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,141
number check the proximity to make sure
that's not far on now

599
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:06,077
if it's not I'm going to say that
they're near the register otherwise

600
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:09,123
they're not near the register and I set
that variable appropriately

601
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:13,095
are more the air things are nurses I'm
also implement the method publication

602
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:13,172
magic did

603
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:18,072
enter region and location measure did X
a region which will be called when the

604
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:23,085
ap is in the for gramm sup for my
example I'm going to go over

605
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:26,114
in the trust the iPhone I have over here

606
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:30,018
you nurse I have my moolah at here and
get a pinata

607
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:33,087
your nurse right here I have my stamp
barcode

608
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:36,166
view and you know it right now it's time
them the to return to the register area

609
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,075
cuz there's no I begin that concurrently

610
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:44,149
attack sup back here on my demo machine
zamka startup in I began

611
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:48,132
and so you know it's there as soon as it
detected that the I became what that was

612
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:51,043
within the region and that was range
crackly

613
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:55,054
I got this nice layer Barker view cell
have another nicer camera

614
00:38:55,054 --> 00:38:58,060
my cashier scanned just run through the
park adds

615
00:38:59,014 --> 00:39:02,091
and do that and sell this view only show
up while I'm

616
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:05,270
in the rat in the near the I began

617
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:10,040
that's appropriate for and so when I
turn this off eventually this app will

618
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:11,058
receive a notification that

619
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:16,073
I've left the region and that this you
should probably be turned off

620
00:39:16,073 --> 00:39:19,149
and was it in your nose I also have a
catalog section

621
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:24,145
South you know it's now that I turn off
the I began that I'm no longer near the

622
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:27,114
register and so the view is turned off

623
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:35,014
and that is how years I begins

624
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:39,044
thanks Alex there's so much you can do
it I beacons

625
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:42,073
out that can provide a really

626
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:45,092
awesome user experience both for your
admins

627
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:49,149
and for the end users alright next

628
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:53,086
I'd like to talk about network
reachability

629
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:56,164
network reachability Sasaram API's

630
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:00,078
that lets you know whether our server is
reachable at all

631
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:04,087
on the network and a best the mall

632
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:08,096
it actually tells you when the server
become searchable or becomes unreachable

633
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:12,110
so for the following example

634
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:16,005
I want you to know you can use that word
reachability

635
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:19,028
to provide intelligent offline

636
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:22,124
behavior so back to Alex and he's gonna
show you how that's done

637
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:27,043
sup back in our Mila

638
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:32,072
I have this method so I call I Crean
ASEAN network reachability flags

639
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:35,140
and I'm gonna create reachability
reference which I do you buy

640
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:40,007
as the network reachability crate with
name and the name and a pass into here's

641
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:41,088
a domain so in my example

642
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:45,090
up above I've defined Apple dock
comments the domain I want you

643
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:49,011
watch for and see the reachability up
and so once I do that if the

644
00:40:49,092 --> 00:40:50,113
reachability is no

645
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:55,068
I can call SC network reachability get
flags and then once I do that I can

646
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:57,075
check the flags and I'm going to check
that

647
00:40:57,075 --> 00:41:00,111
SE network reachability flags our reach
is reachable

648
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:04,090
and using that Pagano when I i can not

649
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:07,088
then a network operations because the
users and airplane

650
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:12,123
for example now this is nice and get but
this is just one of matt that I don't

651
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,080
wanna be calling this all the time

652
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:17,032
so why I really want to do as I want to
register this

653
00:41:18,004 --> 00:41:21,041
so that every time the reachability
configuration changes

654
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:24,082
I get notified and so what I've done
down here

655
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:29,096
as I creatine SE network reachability
contacts I'm which I'm feeling in a nice

656
00:41:29,096 --> 00:41:31,142
little block that created check the
flags and

657
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:35,089
if the flags say that it's not reachable
on going to set my

658
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:38,161
of wine bearable appropriately and one
good years I'm gonna call

659
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:43,097
s the network reachability sec call back
and get feet at the reachability

660
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:47,121
and I have to give it this method which
billy change which is written in C

661
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:51,117
on the reason I put earlier in that
context that im falle

662
00:41:52,017 --> 00:41:56,019
with that call boxes I wanna keep all my
code in objective-c South all I'm going

663
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:59,071
to have my seem at their reachability
change due up here

664
00:41:59,071 --> 00:42:03,129
as I'm just going to have it call that
block that feed into the infall

665
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:07,038
so that I don't have to mess around with
seek out that much sup

666
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:12,067
with the SE network reachability I said
call back i sat the theme at the time

667
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:15,089
calling into in the context and then the
next thing I need to do is I need to

668
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:18,096
make sure I schedule there so that this
gets called every once in a while answer

669
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:20,104
the way I do that as I call

670
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:25,051
SC network reachability fat dispatch
queue: I give the reachability reference

671
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:28,100
that create and I'm not going to call
this on the main kya my example

672
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,049
you can do this another cues I've chosen
this just for simplicity

673
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,090
and so now if we return to my iPhone
example

674
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:39,013
your nurse I have this nice where
catalogue baby clothes that I can buy

675
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:43,069
and so why why do you is I'm just going
to you switch

676
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:47,178
the Anna into airplane mode my switch it
off you know it's there FC network

677
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:50,105
reachability has changed my label to

678
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:55,018
inform the user that they're currently
offline and so you can use if the gate

679
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:58,046
behavior that you don't want users to do
while they are offline like

680
00:42:58,046 --> 00:43:02,107
try and added document that you want to
sync up between multiple users

681
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:06,064
and so that as the network reachability
full

682
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:13,064
thanks Alex network reachability allows
you to you provide

683
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:17,156
intelligent offline behavior without
having to send a request and timing out

684
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:20,081
and things like that you know up front

685
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:23,160
that the network or your particular
server actually is not

686
00:43:24,006 --> 00:43:30,006
reachable and you can take the
appropriate action so

687
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:33,031
in summary our second app example shows
us

688
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:37,152
I that you can put it happen to single
at mote using and EM

689
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:41,057
against example to follow you can use

690
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:46,066
I beacon to provide context for your app

691
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:50,083
and changer app behavior depending on
whether it's near something

692
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:53,144
you can use this work or location to
allow your admins

693
00:43:54,044 --> 00:43:59,070
to really configure your app's to a very
fine grain

694
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:02,054
and finally network reachability allows
you to behave

695
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:08,086
intelligently when a server snot
available

696
00:44:08,086 --> 00:44:12,100
let's talk about a third and final lap
example assessment

697
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,036
so this is your typical example King ap

698
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:21,098
I there are several modes of operation
here

699
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:24,157
I for exams I

700
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:28,060
but far for our example the flow that we
want to show you

701
00:44:28,087 --> 00:44:32,116
is a student operating on an iPad

702
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:36,054
I taking an exam and

703
00:44:36,054 --> 00:44:40,055
we're gonna download the exam packet
from a document provider

704
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:43,086
from your school's filesystem okay

705
00:44:43,086 --> 00:44:46,164
once the user begins taking the exam

706
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:51,077
the exam have a lock them in and depict
the exam

707
00:44:51,077 --> 00:44:56,129
and I'll submit and students will be
allowed to use the iPad again

708
00:44:57,029 --> 00:45:00,088
so let's start with

709
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:03,100
document providers so doctor providers

710
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,049
as I mentioned before is a really
awesome new feature of Iowa State

711
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:12,140
it allows you to exchange documents
between acts

712
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:16,008
when you install ap after docking a
provider

713
00:45:16,044 --> 00:45:19,088
you are actually installing network
access

714
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:23,092
for other APs

715
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:28,094
to access document providers use the UI
document picker view controller

716
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:32,183
this is the same one you use for iPod
dock folder

717
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:36,087
you stalking a providers to get access
to enterprise

718
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:40,110
network resources don't build in

719
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:44,003
network protocols into your ap

720
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:47,015
instead rely on the admin to configure

721
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:51,139
network access maps that allows your app
to access those network resources

722
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,088
alright so let's go back to Alex and
he's gonna show you a little bit of

723
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:58,107
example

724
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:02,084
sup your nurse that I have an
application which have called pencils

725
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:02,151
down and

726
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:06,058
what pencils downs good years that when
did a user starts the path

727
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:11,119
I want them to go into their high school
enter their high schools ap

728
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:16,045
ap document ap and I want them to
retrieve the tasks and then I'm going to

729
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:19,143
proctor the exam on behalf the high
school so in this example

730
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:23,141
when I do start s I have this UI
document picker view controller

731
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:27,076
now I'm going to create one internet
with document types I'm going to allow

732
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:27,152
in this case

733
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:31,067
some good shoes HTML tax in RTF

734
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:34,129
and I'm going to set the mode in this
case I'm going to use you I document

735
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,082
picture mode import

736
00:46:36,082 --> 00:46:39,143
because I want to get the file in keep
it in my app bundle

737
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:43,068
and the RPM going to do use I'm going to
set the delegate

738
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:46,083
on DUI document pay-per-view controller
to myself

739
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:49,122
and I'm going to present that the
extroverted user now

740
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:54,061
when they go into that document pic I
can get two different call backs if for

741
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,160
example they failed pick something they
quite done they don't find

742
00:46:57,006 --> 00:47:01,017
the test file that they won on their I'm
going to get this document picker was

743
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:02,119
cancelled call back

744
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:06,094
and in this case I'm just gonna send a
notification on the console that you

745
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:06,137
know

746
00:47:07,037 --> 00:47:12,045
a I can find the document if for example
they actually depict a document I'll

747
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:13,107
call this document picker

748
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:17,023
depict document you're all will get
called by the system

749
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:20,030
and while the use of double check that
there's a natural your own then

750
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:24,003
I'm going to open up the document and if
I'm successful

751
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:27,090
in opening up the document I'm going to
request single atm

752
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:33,062
and load up the task for them sup if we
go over to the simulator we have our

753
00:47:33,062 --> 00:47:34,062
example here so

754
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:37,091
I pencils down I go into my apt

755
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:40,179
you know sadness knife where testing
view some get a quick start tests cuz I

756
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:41,156
wanna start

757
00:47:42,056 --> 00:47:45,108
it s with that my high school's given me
so I don't a location

758
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:50,033
your nurse that I have the MHS stock
which is a document provider

759
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:54,057
and so I'm going to go into here your
nurses have this view this view is

760
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:55,070
actually coming from the

761
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:58,014
MHS docs apt I have installed in
simulator

762
00:47:58,077 --> 00:48:03,084
issues not created by your apt and so in
this case if I want you I can login

763
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:07,090
MHS stop to check my credentials make
sure I'm actually a high school student

764
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,058
Thunder's girl login with someone
credentials and I'm worse like my

765
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:13,056
program to thank you to do

766
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,062
it so your nurse that once I selected a
my

767
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:20,118
after got that document back in I loaded
up into my nice their web the ins

768
00:48:21,018 --> 00:48:25,094
and started the test and so that's how
document providers work

769
00:48:25,094 --> 00:48:31,122
alright

770
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:35,108
doctor providers are very powerful but
they're very easy to use

771
00:48:36,008 --> 00:48:39,054
as you can tell necks

772
00:48:39,054 --> 00:48:42,077
let's talk about on a single at mod so

773
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:45,113
we've mentioned before that MDM can put
your

774
00:48:46,013 --> 00:48:49,091
ap it put your a device into single app
mod

775
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:53,092
which means that it will only run one ap

776
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:58,095
but in the case of this exam ap we want
the apt to be able to put itself

777
00:48:58,095 --> 00:49:01,136
into single app mod so this mode of
operation

778
00:49:02,036 --> 00:49:05,049
is called autonomous single app mod

779
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:09,118
your app has to be pre-authorized by the
MDM server to do this

780
00:49:10,018 --> 00:49:13,047
and this can only be done on the
supervised device

781
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:16,052
but once that's in place your app can

782
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:20,120
offers of the hey I want control of the
iPad for now

783
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:24,087
so use a condom a single at mote to lock
the user

784
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:29,081
into your ap but please do it sparingly

785
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:32,150
because the user will get stuck in your
app if you don't get them out

786
00:49:33,005 --> 00:49:36,074
your Apple crash and restart crash and
restart

787
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:41,024
and the user will not get out of it so
please be careful when you do this

788
00:49:41,024 --> 00:49:44,047
but it is a really powerful feature so

789
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:48,125
alex is going to demonstrate how you can
do this

790
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:53,043
so we're back to my pencils down
application your nose that here at this

791
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:54,121
requesting a lot mode

792
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:58,067
method that period and what I'm going to
call into is you why

793
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:01,068
accessibility request got it access
session

794
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:04,084
this is the method that will star up
single at Mad

795
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,085
m wide use IP temple in a whether I want
single at mod

796
00:50:07,094 --> 00:50:11,116
honor of and the earthing of feed into
it is a completion block which is

797
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:17,075
Boyd cool did succeed and this Wally and
I get will tell me if I was able t

798
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:21,134
successfully enter or exit signal at my
depending on which Matt I set and the

799
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:26,098
other Boolean arm it's very important
and to balance your calls cuz

800
00:50:26,098 --> 00:50:29,103
as we mentioned you will lock the user
into your at

801
00:50:30,048 --> 00:50:34,107
if you don't call back into their to
turn off single at night as well

802
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:38,060
another important point is to make sure
that you register

803
00:50:38,006 --> 00:50:41,028
the DUI accessibility guided access
status

804
00:50:41,082 --> 00:50:44,118
did change notification this
notification will be sent out when

805
00:50:45,018 --> 00:50:45,066
single

806
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:48,147
at mochi changes and sell why I've done
is like our

807
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:52,096
create a layer math a call guided access
to change adaptation

808
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:55,179
and when I received that notification
I'm just going to update my

809
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,152
single at mod arm was it state and so
your nose here at the have

810
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:04,135
guided access that's changed I set you
know I'm in seeing a lot

811
00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:08,098
if I receive this notification sup
remove over to

812
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:12,154
are iPad and on this iPad it's a
supervised by slavery setup

813
00:51:13,054 --> 00:51:16,061
I've also pushed down and MDM profile
that to find that

814
00:51:17,024 --> 00:51:20,092
pencils down giving it's by no ID is
allowed to start

815
00:51:20,092 --> 00:51:25,095
arm single at mod autonomously so if I
go into pencils down

816
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:29,152
and get start my test I'm gonna skip
over the fire provider section for now

817
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:33,145
and your notice that I am now in my test
if I tried exit the app

818
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:38,049
by pressing the Home button nothing
happens and locked into year

819
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:43,085
so let's add I don't know I am
discretion some justice met the test

820
00:51:43,085 --> 00:51:47,121
an at the test was successfully some and
sell your now nurse if I press the home

821
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:48,086
button

822
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:55,086
I'm able to accept because I bounce the
call

823
00:51:56,008 --> 00:51:59,027
thanks Alex apart in a single at mod

824
00:51:59,027 --> 00:52:02,051
very powerful use it sparingly

825
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:07,056
measure the user can get out of it
eventually

826
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:11,108
so okay summary of the third ap document
providers

827
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:15,059
super powerful new feature an IRS a use
it

828
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:19,135
to gain access to network resources in
your enterprise

829
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:24,073
at a nap equals at network access

830
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:27,116
upon a single at mote allows you to lock
your own app

831
00:52:28,016 --> 00:52:33,111
into single at Mon so the user cannot go
to a different app

832
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:37,030
so what have we learned today

833
00:52:37,003 --> 00:52:40,092
I we learned that we should assume that
MDM will be used to manage your absent

834
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:42,021
devices

835
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:45,021
when you're writing aP's for business
and education

836
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:48,066
assume indians gonna be there and as
going to configure

837
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:51,089
the environment for your ap

838
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:54,145
you can safely assume that enterprise
own devices

839
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:59,051
will be supervised so check up to check
out the list of features that are

840
00:53:00,005 --> 00:53:01,024
available to you

841
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:05,032
when the device is supervised and use
them

842
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:08,120
I on the other hand if you're writing
for bring your own device environment

843
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:14,026
you can re-live that you can assume that
the devices will not be civil rights

844
00:53:14,044 --> 00:53:17,075
so if you're Abbas wanna work in both
environments

845
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:21,172
be aware of the features that are
available in each case

846
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:25,098
and finally rely on i OS

847
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:30,099
to provide a great set of system why
features that your aP's can leverage

848
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:34,013
single sign-on VPN

849
00:53:34,013 --> 00:53:38,058
global proxy manage data flow between
the Manish aP's

850
00:53:38,058 --> 00:53:42,060
and the on Minitab some accounts single
at mod

851
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:45,164
both MDM driven an autonomous

852
00:53:46,064 --> 00:53:49,136
document providers I beacon

853
00:53:50,036 --> 00:53:55,060
and core location for context

854
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:57,100
alright finally I wanna call your
attention to a great new portal that

855
00:53:58,054 --> 00:53:58,141
we've just

856
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:02,088
put online developer to Apple com slash
enterprise

857
00:54:02,088 --> 00:54:09,088
May for developers just like you

858
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:13,141
for more information our eventual assist
bald and bold

859
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:18,420
there's that enterprise portal again
find most of what you need in there

860
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,835
and of course the developer forms is a
great resource

861
00:54:22,249 --> 00:54:25,256
some related sessions

862
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:29,411
this morning we had managing Apple
devices the check out that video

863
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,252
we have distributing enterprise aP's
right here

864
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:37,388
following this session and where if
you're interested and

865
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,571
out big into doc providers talking to
providers

866
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:43,685
building a document based app is a
must-attend

867
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:47,298
Thurs 11:30 thank you very much
