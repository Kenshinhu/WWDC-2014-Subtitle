1
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:14,084
by come to mastering multimedia playback

2
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:16,607
my name is stepping up nigga

3
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,870
amended

4
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:18,165
a team

5
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,162
if you're using a banged-up a BK to a
foundation

6
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:25,106
no ISOs and applications this the right
vision for you

7
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,090
the goal of the session to show you how
easy and powerful

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,009
me get their tickets when I was 8
endorsed in Yosemite

9
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:37,107
if more sessions focus on other major
operations later today

10
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:41,122
and this week you refer it to those at
the end of this talk

11
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:46,037
in the first part of this talk I'm going
to introduce you to a ticket by OS

12
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:49,044
and show you why and how we should use
it in your applications

13
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:52,111
but also give him everything overview of
the most important

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,075
API additions and changes and you I'm
behavior yet for the

15
00:00:56,075 --> 00:01:01,086
bf for you this year in a week at
force10 in the second part of this talk

16
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:06,104
iconic shiny so who 32 best practices
for using a ticket in eighty foundation

17
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:12,059
you I S and with an application's before
that in

18
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:17,198
let's take a quick look dark on me to
stick in Iraq's on the lowest level if

19
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:18,900
the comedy a framework

20
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:23,107
to call home what and yes there a top of
a commute yes it's a V Foundation

21
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:29,077
a powerful objective-c framework they
provide to easy access to me yesterday

22
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,170
finally when you I kid leather

23
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:36,114
we have to meet up their framework
burden you I providing you

24
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:41,173
petechiae in the form of handling the
player controller

25
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:44,590
this year and I was 8

26
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:47,118
reading a new framework but AB kid
replacing parts of the media player

27
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:48,082
framework

28
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:51,921
AB kid

29
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,240
is on you high-level Media Framework
trying to access the rest of them

30
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:57,083
yesterday

31
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,680
not going to show you on this talk with
disabilities hopes up

32
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:04,085
for the IRS applications to be clear

33
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:07,854
not deprecating and people keep their
control I and II 8 but we're strongly

34
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,120
encouraging you to dock AB kit for me a
plate against that

35
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,021
so you have it

36
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:18,105
on what I mean yes they can I O S for
those of you

37
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,024
with north and background you might see
that is

38
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:26,029
spirits pretty similar tell me that the
gun was 10 you're correct

39
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:29,743
infect the same now on both I O S

40
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:33,417
endorsed 10 and will allow you to create
and maintain

41
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,330
cross-platform applications easier than
ever and now

42
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:44,097
I mean to do today to get 50 s sup to
now

43
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:48,114
be provided with two options for media
playback an IRS and people keep their

44
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:50,083
control a

45
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,223
and it's the Ivy control a companion mp3
player the controller

46
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:59,385
and any foundation society might be
using mp3 player controlling

47
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:00,709
applications

48
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,500
which means get that athletic you I
popular access to the media stack

49
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:09,039
which means you're limited to basically
a playback

50
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,953
all you might be using a foundation

51
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,510
and aspects as the mean yes that into
things beyond basic media playback

52
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:23,142
but you've done for many on play
together in the face finally

53
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:27,061
some up to you in the audience might be
the process of getting me a plane ticket

54
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,470
applications

55
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:32,090
maybe Tom in these two options you want
to make your life

56
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,080
as developers easier and that's why it's
something you follow a few

57
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:42,129
every kit provides the boss that's
played a controlled and behave yes

58
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:46,042
but in your full access to the modern
yes that

59
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:51,090
for any foundation last yet we entered
as a beacon rs.10

60
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:58,009
this year hearing every kid over to IRS
growth maybe can I O S

61
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:01,194
it's right here youll ever facilities
for media operations

62
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,390
on top of AB foundation and you like it
me a plague on IRS

63
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:13,103
is no easy a and more powerful than ever
any clear view controller

64
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:18,011
sorry every kid and I US just as any
player view controller up

65
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:22,023
state-of-the-art you're a subclass
rights to the same look and feel

66
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:25,028
as I'll be doubly cations and existing
and him we play our control API

67
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:28,115
he made it really easy for you

68
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:32,015
tied up any player view controller you I
was at the cations

69
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:35,066
let me show you the necessary steps in
the demo

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:40,795
sonics coat betrayed and you I was
application

71
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:46,340
we select the amplification template and
then press the next button

72
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:49,833
as the name we enter every kid player

73
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,770
press Next again

74
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:56,196
Sep the project on the desktop

75
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,954
now

76
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,610
we select the app delegate
implementation and the first you have to

77
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:04,840
do is to impart

78
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:11,500
AB foundation and at a big hit

79
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:18,005
then medication the finish launching
with options

80
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:23,071
the first written a replay of the
Comptroller by calling every play every

81
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,073
controller

82
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,190
up in it and then

83
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,380
betrayed maybe play object calling any
player with URL

84
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,091
and then years and this panel member
under you at for resource extension

85
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:40,147
and recessed name is going to be a long
boring and extension m.o.b

86
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:44,072
is that the playoff tix on a plan view
controller

87
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:47,091
let me set the if they have you control
at the retreat review controller

88
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:50,158
of our window finally

89
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:55,737
we have to move it move your project

90
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:03,259
and if we now build and run

91
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:11,071
you can see we have a fully functional
planning application miss was just be

92
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:12,097
lines of code basically

93
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:16,136
but example is probably not what your
application would look like

94
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:22,099
so let's switch to a different project
the first run this and show you what it

95
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:22,141
is

96
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,119
so this is very simple

97
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,098
me a planning application also media
library will have a reputation

98
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:34,156
and it's using the mustard interview
control a template

99
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:38,095
send the must have you here we have a
list of movies

100
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:41,183
and freed up the movie better company
over

101
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,116
the name of the file and Summit the
Federation anarchic one of the movies

102
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:50,025
you see that in the Detail View we have
some information about the movie

103
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:55,025
and describe oxy a and the rest of this
demo and not going to at

104
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:58,026
any player view controller and so you're
part of it up

105
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:02,108
three-start by modifying the main story
bought

106
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:06,053
as you can see here already have a
container view

107
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:09,119
29 object library

108
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,093
research for levy controller

109
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:16,171
checkin in San star star bart

110
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:21,166
office or you have it and then using a
controlled record

111
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,080
and she is embedded

112
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:28,096
and that began today play Wii U
controller up for going to interview

113
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:32,104
now we need to select the Segway

114
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,010
an inspector give it and identify a

115
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:43,064
in this case we just year's show movie
since we're using every player

116
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:44,095
controlling the storyboard

117
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:48,061
lots have too many link against the if
you could let

118
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:52,140
library from a so falling from UConn
libraries

119
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:57,073
we had a new framework sweet I pin

120
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,050
every kid selected in a press that
button

121
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:05,039
and now we have to modify didn't have
the control implementation

122
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:10,091
again the first thing we have to do is
to impart they had a fire

123
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:15,110
to import a foundation and impart any
kid

124
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:19,075
know when to implement the prepare for a
sec with send a

125
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:23,142
limitation the first

126
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:27,098
respect for the be taken into fire when
make sure that is so movie

127
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:30,110
then

128
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:34,062
get a BKB controller which is the this
mission control of the Segway

129
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:38,130
and finery be creating a play at the
same as we did before but using play

130
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:39,077
with you al

131
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:44,025
and as the to the control as a movie
property which itself Saur

132
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:47,081
and he said there's a tear up let's play
object

133
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:54,081
on the play Wii controller we know
burden run

134
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,154
conflict in moving can see that the
movie is not a Kia

135
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:05,133
and we can press player an impressive
was going button

136
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,088
goes into full screen and annotated to
landscape

137
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:14,096
they can see it's fully working right

138
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:18,667
sex I wanna show you highly-paid the
controller works and a foundation

139
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,720
city for those of you in the audience
that and you take the foundation a plan

140
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:24,149
view controller

141
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:29,838
but the strong reference in any playoff
checked this object provides the content

142
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,366
and every playoff segment is in a play
item which says the mutable data

143
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:35,230
structure

144
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,490
from in middle and yes at this means

145
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:43,051
knows what content on any play the
controller if through the following

146
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:43,123
steps:

147
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:47,132
first

148
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,370
Creighton ABS it from an issue for see I
can either be a look if I on this

149
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:56,042
or remote URL it may be s at

150
00:09:56,087 --> 00:10:02,173
going to rate maybe play item 17 every
play item you can trade name play object

151
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:08,091
and finally such as a replay of sex with
the a player view controller

152
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:11,132
but if you don't

153
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:15,035
need to inspect any properties just
south of the content and just want to

154
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:16,126
play but every player the Contra

155
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:22,068
in two of us that's at once sex on you
in the demo

156
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:25,080
indirectly create and every play object
come in an issue rather

157
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:30,012
imparted to the replay view controller
and as a chance that the only reason why

158
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:32,007
inspected the ABS too far

159
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:37,266
was in order to implemented on public
use interface maybe kid

160
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,620
don't use anymore said he would take a
look at the replay the eventual API

161
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:46,067
my notice that set the player property
there isn't really much more

162
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:50,129
but there's so much stuff just get just
get automatically

163
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,118
the any further set up here's a list of
the most important every play every

164
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:58,073
battle a few just for your reference

165
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:02,170
might notice that is mostly identical to
mp3 player controller

166
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:08,041
never reason for that you want to make
your condition to educate

167
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:14,080
s easy as possible but doesn't you not
familiar with a movie player controller

168
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:20,047
let me show you what is he just makes
you look like a plate you control a

169
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,030
has a depth player controls is different
from

170
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:29,011
mp3 player controller and every player
be on August 10 instead of setting a

171
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,056
certain controlled style

172
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,142
anyplace you control automatically
adapts the cup and control set for you

173
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:38,043
justice on the demo when you show a
movie in bed at

174
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:41,131
unification and use a presence that
episode types they're pushing button

175
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:46,086
a player you control automatically
switches to put simply the controls

176
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:52,105
you don't want to show any controls at
all

177
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:59,029
select the option to hide them be taken
to assess the democratic control its

178
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,091
sofa converts chapters tapping the
Seebeck what was the comment button

179
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:10,091
fix the previous an acceptor for content
with this ruling it just subtitles

180
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:16,060
if they're going to let the media
selection button

181
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:21,070
along the user to select a different
audio a subtitle track

182
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:27,076
the name it also means

183
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:30,140
they play view controller met get
switched to defensive player controls

184
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:34,021
for live streaming content don't have to
do anything

185
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:38,066
finally

186
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,581
a play view controller has built-in
support about at play

187
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:46,100
and HDMI sony's enables airplay

188
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:50,023
pop acts an HDMI adapter application
automatic present the content on

189
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:50,123
external screen

190
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:57,882
keeping the player controls on the IRS
device sexy I replied you're going to

191
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:58,520
last

192
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:03,861
ends up again something we've never
trust a fun every major feature

193
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:08,366
as a better than any kid as well but if
you look closely

194
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:13,970
we notice one difference as I mentioned
before

195
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:16,151
a plate you control a america's elect to
close at four you

196
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:20,078
so this to less less for you to worry
about

197
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,497
but actually there's a lot more

198
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,060
let's take a look it up there Graham
from earlier for bed

199
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:32,029
if you want to replace the country play
item

200
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,688
did you use your place tonight Smith
play item on any player

201
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,930
but if you already know in advance for
the next item is going to be

202
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:42,128
you can have any foundation navel gazing
at you

203
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:50,028
to get smooth playback and switching to
the next play item is an energy player

204
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:54,024
if you play as a subclass of any player
the closet and

205
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:57,243
you a list a replay items each of which
is backed by

206
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,850
yes it

207
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,180
everything I'm showing it today and what
every player contra excess 582 pass

208
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,027
while

209
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:08,137
25 just talked about basically a play
that

210
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:13,122
with a foundation you can do a lot more
all

211
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:18,026
every composition the subclass ABS at
lawsuit a great mighty clip

212
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:21,116
and might attract media compositions

213
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:29,016
as a result the seventy years and our me
sum up your video editing applications

214
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,042
it doesn't matter if you provide
anyplace you control a maybe play item

215
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:40,005
that ban ABS said on a decomposition
either works fine

216
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:45,068
a composition sought to enter points to
you more advanced features

217
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:50,014
for instance it may be a composition
allows you to apply FN transforms

218
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:54,872
and simple chat to the transitions
popular content

219
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,920
you can even create your own custom
composite asked to create all kinds of

220
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:00,116
the effects

221
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:05,945
any arguments provides a similar
functionality for your tracks

222
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,126
any given position at the autorads
working combination any foundation sorry

223
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,110
any composition you want to analyze

224
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:16,014
25 with allies raw data during playback

225
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:20,023
you can use them to order processing tap

226
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:23,067
is it just a few classes today finish
provides you for many operations beyond

227
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:26,113
basic media playback

228
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:30,106
you want to learn more about this topic
take a appear as BBC sessions

229
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:37,008
like this one from last year and related
sent a card

230
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:42,047
let's take a look again at all this to
pay pay via Kentucky chess

231
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:45,073
says that shown in this talk in Pavia
pantalla

232
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:49,139
just the same he just sort of the same
features century player controller

233
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,064
but due to the full access to any
foundation

234
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:59,069
you get so much more

235
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:03,047
let me show you what can you do know a
foundation dedicated

236
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:07,123
your own I was at the cations

237
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:11,065
so there's an iPad version of the movie
Live evocation that his earlier to show

238
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:14,079
you how to use a player contra

239
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,608
and this demo I can now add the effect
the movies

240
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,770
as you can see edit that you could
affect to this movie

241
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:26,091
right now the effect is your impact I
want to stop dragging him goes up or

242
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:26,172
down

243
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:34,072
you can see how I can change certain you
that is in the movie

244
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:38,091
each and they represent you value on the
columbia and changing ahead and modify

245
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:39,801
set color

246
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,920
ship the cuts are different value

247
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:48,125
against up to any frame in the movie for
just the values

248
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:53,061
see a helmet for instance

249
00:16:53,061 --> 00:17:00,061
let's go back to the beginning it's a
plane

250
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:04,206
says he can see the effects applied in
real time

251
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,847
and on the right edited with digital
media but also the

252
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,760
volume for the left and right on your
chin up during playback

253
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:16,138
not to do all of this applications is in
a fantastic position at the I

254
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,073
dimension 2400

255
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:25,272
a week it continues to menace the user
interface just as adults

256
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:32,929
for basic media playback cases

257
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,133
not have shown you how easy it is to
adopt any player view controller

258
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:44,075
many of the cation and what amazing
things you can do in commission a

259
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:44,884
foundation

260
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,900
I hope you can't wait to adopt any
player view controller the existing

261
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:48,088
applications

262
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,558
not too happy with the condition

263
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm going to highlight the necessary
steps for the three common scenarios

264
00:17:56,002 --> 00:18:00,981
in the first scenario

265
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:05,370
using any player layer and possibly
implemented on to use interface

266
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:09,102
thought of by replacing any player they
are back to you I've you

267
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:14,028
and user interface type: eric is
interface but every player you can trust

268
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:14,070
you

269
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:19,084
then that the player property on a plate
you control a and set up a play earlier

270
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:24,099
never chance that most of the remaining
coat with the unchanged

271
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:30,105
lessons and specially I needs if you're
using and can we play our view

272
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:31,124
controller

273
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:36,077
just her place and he will be clear view
controller lol in a bit continue for

274
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:40,726
by every player view contra ataque in it
and then create an associate the replay

275
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:42,120
object

276
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:46,035
attorney before however

277
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:49,079
if you are also accessing the engine
repair contract property

278
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:56,079
that scenario supplies Tia city using
and can we play contra on your vacations

279
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,940
it in with a couple more properties and
methods but don't worry

280
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:06,100
the conditions exit quite
straightforward and can be played on

281
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,099
track I can be grouped into two classes

282
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,658
uses a pic API across the pacific API

283
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,520
in the former case you use a plan you
can't relate the I

284
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:19,066
analytic a CD player and then play item
API

285
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:23,161
things like and the movie era la can
improve the excess lock

286
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:27,122
actually very thin wrapper object around
every play item X is looking to play at

287
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:29,071
a maryland for instance

288
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:33,073
yet to thank you much just you should
watch out for them

289
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:36,126
as I mentioned before

290
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:40,107
a player you can trust controlled first
and then it so there's no set a property

291
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:45,996
also and the movie play contra ought to
place by default

292
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:52,720
a player does not do that this anything
you cannot do I do not know how to do

293
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:55,151
with AV Kidney Foundation and switching
over from

294
00:19:56,051 --> 00:20:00,051
from anti-nuclear controller Stockton
elapse

295
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:04,052
ask us and developer forums Letterkenny

296
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:07,510
if I S in our state

297
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,190
being a ticket over from was 10 as on
you I'll ever need a framework for a

298
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:12,027
foundation

299
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:16,144
a player the Contra provides just enough
to control its

300
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:20,128
and behavior give you full access to a
powerful multimedia stack

301
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:24,060
to please consider adopting any player
controller

302
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:27,008
and you I of the cations finally

303
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:30,094
want to give you a brief update on a
because 10

304
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:34,113
as he said yesterday in a keynote

305
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:38,036
what's in your seventy receive the I
refreshed that there is out

306
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:43,101
with a brand new UI for a week as well
if you're using a replay review

307
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:49,019
applications were received in you I
automatically going to change a single

308
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:49,098
line of code

309
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:53,180
up to ten in the fight you're not using
any baby yet

310
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:58,267
despite a good time to adopt the
introduction of a ticket buyers

311
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,140
what's out there in some user interfaces
and behaviors a player view

312
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:10,014
to make a pledge a controller you want
to learn more about how to use a clear

313
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,020
view

314
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:13,072
to check out last yes moving to a ticket
in eighty foundation

315
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:18,110
session and finally

316
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:22,320
for brand new class for you this year
and it was 10

317
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:26,520
he kept on you provide to you never
capture facilities

318
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:29,114
into a foundation napkins not being

319
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:34,065
intended it as an aficionado is coming
to the chemical to talk tomorrow morning

320
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:39,121
process in the lab said it is
interesting to you and now

321
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:43,620
then head over to fill a foundation
engineer to show you how to get the most

322
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:44,360
out of

323
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,061
a ticket and a foundation the IRS and
authentications

324
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:54,061
thank you Thank You chiffon

325
00:21:56,084 --> 00:22:00,128
good morning I'm shyly foul an engineer
on the V Foundation team

326
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:05,045
and I'm here to talk to you today about
best practices before we get into the

327
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:06,100
details of these practices

328
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,079
for a show of hands how many of you have
used a B foundation before

329
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,085
lots love you

330
00:22:13,085 --> 00:22:16,164
for you I would hope this section 3rd as
an update

331
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:20,200
or refresher on best practices as
technology

332
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:24,054
a balance with time so do best practices
for those of you want you to leave the

333
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:25,076
foundation

334
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:28,076
I hope this serves as a guideline on how
to approach

335
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:32,099
abit let's get started by talking about

336
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:35,112
why you would be interested in adopting
such practices

337
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:40,070
what's the motivation these practices
are designed to make your application

338
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:43,098
as efficient and perform and that's
possible making it responsive

339
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:47,130
doin users not only help with the
application

340
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:51,010
efficiency but also help make your
program

341
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,129
yeah help improve your program
correctness making it robust

342
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:59,038
and preventing any thoughts of Hank up
precious

343
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,107
media obligations some banks make use of
expensively sources like netbooks

344
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:08,025
these best practices our Design so that
you can make efficient use of such

345
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,064
resources

346
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:12,135
and lastly users will be thankful for
the improvement they see in their

347
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,063
battery life

348
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:18,145
as your application uses very little
about

349
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:22,754
here's a modern media fact we looked at
only in this top

350
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,160
eighty foundation sits on top of coal
media and its family a framework

351
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:31,193
and on top it AB kid which provides you
with standard playback controls with

352
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,414
just few lines of code

353
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:37,220
the focus for this section today is best
practices

354
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:40,055
specifically in the areas of inspection
and playback

355
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:43,082
if you would like to gain more
information about eighty foundation in

356
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:44,085
general

357
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:47,122
you can look at this stock from the BBC
2011

358
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:52,080
call exploring AB foundation

359
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:55,076
based on the two major categories for
any

360
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:59,084
AB foundation object I'm ordered
separately

361
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:04,087
for the first category we didn't spec
Shin ABS and is an example

362
00:24:05,014 --> 00:24:08,082
with any BS it as a client on this API
you want in charge

363
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:11,170
of eroding values whenever you need it
in your application

364
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:15,106
you can initiate I O and men AB
foundation request

365
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:20,087
the thieves a request for I O we go and
do all the looting work

366
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:24,136
so you can get a value the best practice
here

367
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,500
is to request values a synchronously why
a thing is loading

368
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:31,094
rely on to that in just few slides

369
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,104
for the other category would display
back AB player and playwright them

370
00:24:36,004 --> 00:24:39,019
other controller object all you have to
do here

371
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,058
it's free and easy items and then he
should be back

372
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:45,129
eighty foundation and its underlying
machinery drive

373
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,048
in the playback Clark so that the user
fee

374
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:52,977
media freedoms on bank so when you hit
play

375
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,970
we drive the necessary machinery select
you use again experience a small

376
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:57,152
playback

377
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:01,126
as time progresses properties change and
if you would like to keep your

378
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:02,101
application

379
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,052
state up to date with the feed on the
Playback Engine

380
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:09,059
you can use and SQL you observing to be
notified

381
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:16,059
of such changes and if you are you
observing is also called at gave you

382
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:20,548
here's a look at are object diagram from
earlier

383
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,220
Stefan show you in a demo how to use
these objects and create a simple media

384
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,047
application

385
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:29,146
now let's use this as a roadmap for
talking about best practices

386
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:35,145
class by class starting with ABS said

387
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,890
as I mentioned earlier with AB asset you
can use

388
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:41,144
any if you can if you value loading
while poverty by method

389
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:47,086
which lets you load property a
synchronously before accessing them

390
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:51,135
for example if you're interested in the
precise duration opacity

391
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:56,320
you cannot be punishing for the duration
and redownload just about dried them on

392
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:57,034
to bigger

393
00:25:57,052 --> 00:26:01,054
to be able to tell you what the duration
it but I'm file format it

394
00:26:01,072 --> 00:26:02,074
straightforward

395
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:06,013
and that somebody information right up
ahead so we can download just that the

396
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:07,780
sub ita

397
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:10,081
but that's not always the case

398
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:13,090
sometimes many of us what you're a shin
any foundation would have to download

399
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,096
the entire fund into the media file

400
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:21,805
bar said be coated before we can give
you the value for a precise duration:

401
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:26,669
you might our why should I do anything
gonna keep a B foundation has to do all

402
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,720
this work

403
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:30,491
the Lord values or it big time to load
values

404
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:35,143
well you really should I'll I don't
spend

405
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,181
if you tried to access a property think
honestly by

406
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:41,431
accessing a ghetto before loading the
property

407
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:45,310
you would be blocking a main thread
leading to a spin and making your

408
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:45,112
application

409
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:49,301
unresponsive doin user

410
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:52,990
on a stand however you can dispatch this
work to a background

411
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:56,172
cue to access the get a and you 1 p.s
penny

412
00:26:57,072 --> 00:27:00,084
met on I with loading think lesly from

413
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:05,091
any thread would block your application
and could lead to a hand a crash

414
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:09,100
this is because as you may already know
on i OS

415
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,026
we have a shared demand by media so they
be

416
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:17,935
with services media requests on behalf
of your application

417
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,242
if you tried to access a property
synchronously you would be bang media

418
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:22,710
seventy

419
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:25,106
or forcing me to 72 Lord aware you and
this might be

420
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:29,037
time this leads to a timeout

421
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:32,076
and media services domination

422
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,483
this not only affects your application
but every other application on the

423
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,860
system

424
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:42,127
which relies on media services so please
don't do that

425
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:47,166
now that we know that a good reason to
use ABA's even if the value loading

426
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:50,500
there don't want things to remember for
key

427
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:54,007
only load those properties you and this
baby using your application

428
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:58,206
every extra property means more work if
you intend to not use a particular

429
00:27:58,899 --> 00:27:59,820
property

430
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:02,661
do not in Goa the wasted work

431
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,475
and the second thing is if you and it's
been the use of a particular property

432
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,040
you doing your application

433
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:12,053
you can still request all of them
together using

434
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:15,135
note values a synchronous people key and
completion handler

435
00:28:16,035 --> 00:28:19,059
you can Boston and i do. he's eighty
foundation would

436
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,148
will go together and your conclusion
handler is called

437
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,754
once we are done loading these
properties

438
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:30,454
you no longer have to learn tracks
before playback begin

439
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,070
this has changed since the last time we
talked about best practices

440
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:37,025
in fact this has changed since I was 5

441
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:40,664
you really only need to load those
property you would directly use in your

442
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:43,220
application

443
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:46,037
now let's look at how ABA think a nifty
value loading

444
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:50,086
conflates into court in this particular
example

445
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:53,092
I'm interested in loading the property
the open

446
00:28:54,046 --> 00:29:00,055
I boson an atty the displayable in it
and I provide a completion handler

447
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:04,086
in my completion handler I first check
to make sure the properties loaded

448
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:07,375
sometimes things go wrong like if you're
relying on the netbook resource

449
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:12,198
and usable the light goes out of range
after blowing can feel

450
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:15,713
so this is a good place to check with
such adonis

451
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,750
once you get the status you can see if
it's already loaded

452
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:23,724
and then you're gonna be a quoi or up
for the asset

453
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,570
are if there's a failure you can abort
and appropriate EDA

454
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:33,076
to you end-user one more thing to
remember with completion handler

455
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:36,120
is if another module has already loaded

456
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:40,008
the keys you're interested in your
completion handler is called back

457
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:43,027
immediately stay in this example

458
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:46,498
if a beep leo has already landed the
playable property

459
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,390
your completion handler is called
synchronously on the same

460
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,399
thread if you have poured which relies
on load values a thing that people can

461
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,330
use to get done

462
00:29:56,033 --> 00:30:00,110
immediately that might not happen though
the completion handler has executed

463
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:05,790
so that's something to keep in mind to
prevent a deadlock

464
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:09,050
lift the best practices for Absa

465
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:13,334
not only does he's you're interested in
using in your application

466
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:17,408
you can use a BA thinking if you value
noting the list all the fuse together

467
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:21,670
in an atty and you can provide a
completion handler but despite want your

468
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,810
downloading this property

469
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,950
and your completion handler check to
make sure the properties are loaded:

470
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:29,090
before you access them

471
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:32,048
and lastly be prepared for synchronous
call back

472
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:35,073
if someone else has already loaded the
property on your behalf

473
00:30:35,073 --> 00:30:38,078
yet read if I'd your completion handler
is buyback

474
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:42,176
immediately those were best practices
for Absa

475
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:47,195
now let's look at every player and
playwright and

476
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,970
as I mentioned earlier but they be
clearer and clearer I do

477
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:55,098
the playback engine under the underlying
playback engine drives the machinery

478
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:59,072
necessary so that your user fees we your
dreams on bank

479
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:03,079
so you have to do is use and if the
value observing RKB 0

480
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,144
to be notified of the change it so that
you can update your application state

481
00:31:08,044 --> 00:31:11,050
here's an example if you have a
progressive download item

482
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:16,087
on an HTTP fella as a bee foundation
download some data

483
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:19,185
you get the ball back with the loaded
range as a buffer more data

484
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:24,904
you get get on the ball back with the
updated value for the Lagrange

485
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:28,692
a take an example of bacterial might
come in handy

486
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:33,270
its playback interruption if you use and
divide the deceived

487
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:38,082
8 phone call or FaceTime call when
you're application is being a paedophile

488
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:42,180
your playback is interrupted so that you
use again on for the call

489
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:46,847
in this case if you do you think AB or
on the player 38

490
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,706
you would see it transitioned is eel
this is a good

491
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,314
there is a good way for you doing be
notified of such interruption

492
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:59,891
so that your dont and upgrading and
lately probably back to end

493
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:04,000
and the last example here is media
services to be fit

494
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,159
as I mentioned earlier if your
application of some other application

495
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,290
wasn't paying attention to ABA thinking
it's p-value loading

496
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,058
and try to access a property think
honestly you have forced media server

497
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,537
need to dominate

498
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:21,990
this FX your application do your media
services %uh defect

499
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:25,151
amend this happened your plate icon
status transition to feed

500
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:29,940
and this is the place for you did throw
away all your lead object and rebuild

501
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,450
your player and playwright them

502
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:36,960
defending a playback

503
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:43,620
let's look at an example in court make a
view might come in handy

504
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:47,109
in this example I would like to decide
when to show or do you only you I in my

505
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,035
application

506
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:52,614
your I first created playwright amid an
acid

507
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,300
then I tried to access the tracks
property of an acid particularly

508
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:59,047
up by video and then I checked to make
sure

509
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:03,233
that the media Trac then only your
tracks before I obeyed my UI dual audio

510
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,977
only

511
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,990
this is not compete he got a firstly
we're trying to access the tracks

512
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:11,133
property on acid

513
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:15,512
without prior loading it this good
blocking a main thread and make your

514
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,050
application and responsive

515
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:21,032
and the second thing here is an
assumption that lack of media Trac

516
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,881
means audio only you can have
non-renewal Richard Wright

517
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,300
like subtitle in your movies

518
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:31,832
now let's look at how I can do this
using k Beale

519
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:35,590
I add myself as an observer for the
presentation size

520
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:38,778
on a playwright and and months AB
foundation is downloading the

521
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,314
presentation face

522
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:45,190
your observational buyback first check
to make sure that your presentation

523
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:45,108
thighs and feet away

524
00:33:46,008 --> 00:33:51,047
you know this way you know not have the
tracks have a non-zero presentation safe

525
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:54,073
cannot do that make sure you have
accused

526
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,082
1 %uh audio track to do that

527
00:33:57,082 --> 00:34:01,085
you can look at the underlying a be at
the track and make sure that

528
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:05,094
there's ok he's one of them which has a
AB media characteristic audible

529
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:09,694
this is necessary because sometimes you
can have movie filed

530
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:14,730
which have non over $10,000 by you know
for the presentation sized

531
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:19,081
but no audio track like bangor tracks

532
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:24,098
the PBRs be we just used before us
create a playwright amid an asset

533
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:27,179
then be there just about the value
observing the property of interest

534
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,144
after that me associate the bleary-eyed
amid the player

535
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:35,131
and in your observation by back you can
look at the change dictionary

536
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:40,083
to know what the new value is this is
the day to be when you work with these

537
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,402
objects

538
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,158
but if you want things to remember when
you're interacting with these objects in

539
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:47,084
general

540
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,640
but not assume the order in which events
up up

541
00:34:51,064 --> 00:34:54,064
as soon as you associate a playwright
amid the player

542
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:57,079
85 nations dot its underlying machinery
so that

543
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,088
you're using an expedient this mod
playback

544
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:03,121
on Iowa 7 be made an optimization
beating this

545
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:07,035
the status to ready to play much more
quickly

546
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:10,044
so if you want to add yourself as an
observer after you create a plea over

547
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,033
the playwright him

548
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:15,048
you could miss this white notification

549
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:19,050
the pink this you can add yourself as an
observer before associating you play

550
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:20,135
item in the play okay

551
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,119
that way you won Miss any notifications

552
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:29,110
are sometimes in your application you
might have a particular fan i do.

553
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:33,016
where you would like to add yourself as
an observer

554
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:37,025
only of good any bank see if a user
presses a button

555
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:40,092
in touch basis you been used and if the
value observing

556
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:44,158
option initiated this flag lets you
access the initial value as well as in

557
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:48,122
you and you

558
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:53,026
the second thing to remember is that AB
foundation theory licensed the access to

559
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,068
every player and playwright him

560
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:58,098
on the main cue it safe to access

561
00:35:58,098 --> 00:36:01,101
and register and unregister for
observers

562
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:06,004
for these objects on the mean cue this
was done to prevent any possible

563
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:07,263
refinishing

564
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:11,060
as might have been more used to
interacting with these objects

565
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:15,018
and make you was a natural choice as
most of these observations buyback

566
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:18,044
lead to your applications in traction
but you like it objects

567
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:21,213
which also happened on me cue

568
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,684
however this does not mean that we are
doing our work on a min Q

569
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,359
we are not effecting the end-user
responsiveness

570
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:31,850
all loading and playback related what
happens on the background cue

571
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:35,124
the only feel like the access to these
objects on the mean cue

572
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:39,049
if in your application you have a
particular sin i do. for

573
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:42,146
makes you think this requirement is a
hindrance please come talk to us in our

574
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:44,054
labs

575
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:47,113
of I'll enhancement request they are
really interested in listening to your

576
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:50,079
feedback on this

577
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,083
and the last thing to remember is
wherever possible

578
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,081
set up your playwright him before
associating it with the player

579
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,090
as I mentioned earlier as soon as you
create a player

580
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,638
AB foundation starts driving its
machinery so that we can get ready for

581
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:06,200
playback

582
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:09,851
for example if you have a streaming item
as soon as you create a player

583
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:15,000
we go over the network and start
downloading data from the fourth time

584
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,029
and after that if you are def issue a
thick dude I'm

585
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:21,980
we would have to throw away all the data
we downloaded and start reloading up

586
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:23,166
fascists to begin playback

587
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:28,071
in order to bring in that whenever
possible you can always fun video player

588
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:28,120
item

589
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:32,081
before associating it with the play here

590
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:36,480
here's a few examples up the banged-up
on for the nation's you can do

591
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:39,120
this is definitely not the exhaustive
list but just a few

592
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:45,063
you can add outputs you can select media
options like audible and legible

593
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:49,145
you can fact followed and robust
playback and times I seek the time

594
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:57,045
and after doing all those changes I can
associate my clear I don't the player

595
00:37:57,096 --> 00:38:00,114
in somebody for any player and a ride em

596
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:04,733
use an FTP are you observing to be
notified of changes

597
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:08,220
at the Playback Engine is driving the
clock

598
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:12,051
did got so that you use again experience
this mode play back

599
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:16,069
do not rely on the order in which event
up to if you really need a budget lol

600
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:19,151
you can always use and if the value
observing option any Shin

601
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:25,380
auto add yourself as observers before
you create a player

602
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,920
the fear life your access to play and
play item on the main cue to avoid any

603
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:30,175
boys big race conditions

604
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:35,138
lucky menopausal set up your plan died
in bed autoconfiguration

605
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:40,079
before creating a player those were the
best practices for

606
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,144
AB player and fan item most of the
things we don't know about

607
00:38:44,044 --> 00:38:47,098
AB player also applied to a BBQ player

608
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:52,207
as you've seen earlier in this top a V
QPR take a list of playwright and

609
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:56,910
if in your application you have an
Inspector window

610
00:38:56,091 --> 00:39:00,960
for which you would like to access a set
of keys on each of the brand items

611
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,870
you can use AB playwright them spend
mean an initializer

612
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:09,121
which lets you buy a set of keys which
AB cube lia aur abbo would yield

613
00:39:10,021 --> 00:39:14,360
on your behalf you have a BBQ player

614
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:19,270
the list of items and if you initialize
each of these items into the set of keys

615
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:22,116
as a BQ player is getting ready to
initiate any should be back with a

616
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:23,104
particular item

617
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:27,099
reload the 15th in combination with the
keys require

618
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:31,156
for playback and as playback from
dresses and we teach the next item

619
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:37,058
we load the second set of keys you
requested for that particular item

620
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:40,149
this is valid for every player has been
if you're using replaced got and item

621
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:42,096
but derided

622
00:39:42,096 --> 00:39:46,108
you can miss you can use this as an
alternate to ABA think a nifty value

623
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:47,013
noting

624
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:50,587
answer abusing a v8 thing if you are you
looking for each of the asset

625
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,850
you can initialize each of the brand
items and we'll take care of you reading

626
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:55,162
the property

627
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:59,095
and if you're using this in 30 periods
even if the value noting

628
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:02,194
the best place to access your property

629
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:06,710
would be to cameo the playwright and
status

630
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,147
many receive an observation by back for
the status

631
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:13,166
and if you up to me lol and if the
sentence is ready to play

632
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:18,200
you acted keys would either be loaded of
real so then you can use status of value

633
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:18,065
for key

634
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,362
to access this property

635
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:26,510
and the last thing to remember but
eighty cuba is if AB foundation en donde

636
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,320
as andado

637
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:30,812
with a body blow playwright him miss
give that item and move on

638
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:35,120
so that your user experiences
uninterrupted playback

639
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:38,017
however if you would like to be notified
of such I don't

640
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:45,017
you can NS email you observe a week you
play with God and item status

641
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:49,495
those were some tips for using a BQ
player lastly

642
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:53,850
let's talk about ATP a view controller

643
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:57,118
but the repair your gun drawn on highway
audio replay review on all with 10

644
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:01,076
it's a good idea to animate your view
India view hierarchy

645
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:04,102
only when there's some why the funding
to present

646
00:41:05,002 --> 00:41:08,097
only if there's some video frames you
can chill and to do that

647
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:11,135
you can t value observed ready for
display on i OS

648
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:15,044
you would observe on the plan view
controller that as a nice tan you

649
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:16,713
observe on the blame you

650
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:20,560
got himself as an observer put any for
display

651
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:23,114
and in your observation buyback you can
check to make sure ready for displays

652
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:24,903
yes

653
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:32,029
before animating your view or before
like showing you

654
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:37,168
new NIOS 8 and North 10th and not then
its content to live you

655
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,690
but going to leave you you can do your
custom drying

656
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:44,077
and rendering or would the playable the
condo LabVIEW is guaranteed to have

657
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:47,093
similar dimensions as the plan view

658
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:50,114
and if you would like to place the order
drying tube relative to the radio for

659
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:51,068
him

660
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:56,072
you can access the media bronze property
on the play view controller

661
00:41:56,072 --> 00:42:00,139
here's a screenshot above the demo Meath
audio the did you do what you need on

662
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:01,133
the bottom right

663
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:06,022
was rendered using going to leave you

664
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,690
and lastly what chapter navigation: as
you may have seen in QuickTime Player

665
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:15,108
when you see two chapters using the
appropriate keyboard shortcut to menu

666
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:16,087
items

667
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:20,087
big-time player briefly flashes the
Japanese were indicted

668
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:23,108
and if you would like to get similar
behavior in your applications

669
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,060
which we highly recommend you can use
this API I've

670
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:33,008
a deeply love you this is only on with
Dan the flash at the number and ID

671
00:42:33,062 --> 00:42:36,073
ideally you would do this often seek has
completed

672
00:42:36,073 --> 00:42:42,127
so you can place this code in your
completion handler for think the time

673
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,034
for the best practices for play Wii U
controller is to observe ready for

674
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,466
display to know when to present your
view on screen

675
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:54,200
so that you use it doesn't have to look
at black screen

676
00:42:54,002 --> 00:42:57,048
thank you then we saw how do you respond
in to leave you want to do custom

677
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:58,015
rendering

678
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,830
over the play a few in the auto the baby
is below

679
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:06,112
and about that despondent over live you
and the control said on top

680
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:11,180
and lucky we saw how to flash up to numb
Japanese number and title

681
00:43:11,018 --> 00:43:16,029
during chapter navigation: using every
period

682
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:20,268
that brings us to the end of I roadmap
for best practices

683
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:24,120
let's wrap up

684
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:28,054
below that why it's important the Lord
values a synchronously and how to do

685
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:32,543
that using a BA think a nifty value
looking for a bf it

686
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:37,250
but every player and playwright im all
you have to do is use and its key value

687
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:37,098
observing

688
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:41,707
to be notified of changes and made a bet
some tips for using

689
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:46,390
a BQ player we don't know about how to
observe

690
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:51,238
ready for display know when to present
your view India view hierarchy

691
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:55,620
and then we looked at how to customize
your plan view my custom drawings in

692
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:56,721
going to leave you

693
00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:01,370
and displaying chapter numbers during
navigation

694
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:04,121
that was best practices for a be
foundational a ticket I lost topic but

695
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:06,116
to me

696
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:10,021

701
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:29,520

powerful eighty foundation can be in

702
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:30,871
combination with AB kid
