1
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:15,807
hi everyone I'm Claire and I'm on the
island successfully team

2
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:20,550
here at Apple today I'll be sharing with
you about accessibility I i OS

3
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:23,444
and how you can get all your app's to be
used by everyone

4
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,000
our talk today is going to be in two
parts

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,084
first are given introduction to
accessibility

6
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:35,169
I'll talk about some the features we
offer I was currently

7
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,278
as well as a new things coming in I was
8

8
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,590
in a second hardest talk

9
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:47,508
I'll be showing you how you can make
your app successful both by adding

10
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,080
visual accommodations

11
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:56,449
and by implementing magic accessibility

12
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,682
so first what is accessibility

13
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,241
accessibility is all about making things
usable

14
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,200
for everyone I O S we look at four broad
areas

15
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,351
have your needs we want users with

16
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,581
physical motor challenges users with
learning needs

17
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,876
users with hearing loss and uses a
different vision needs

18
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,944
to be able to experience I West fully
our goal is equal access

19
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,780
for everyone so let's look at some
examples

20
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,172
how e-commerce this some users may have
a physical impairment that prevents them

21
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:37,127
from using the touchscreen

22
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:41,186
in fact there only infer device maybe

23
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:44,810
a switch a switch could be something
like a button

24
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:47,150
mounted on a wheelchair had best so how
do we make

25
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:52,624
the rich touch interface I'll ask usual
by someone who can only use a switch

26
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,700
I answer is switch control

27
00:01:57,007 --> 00:02:00,956
when special the naval a cursor appears

28
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,750
on the street and moves for item

29
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:09,086
to Adam with a specific time when the
user

30
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,605
activator switch that wasn't interact
with the highlighted on

31
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,415
so they can do things like top or scroll

32
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,772
necklace look at

33
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,125
learning I was devices have an
incredibly powerful

34
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:27,760
in the classroom because other easy to
use interface

35
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:32,083
and they're engaging aP's for the same
reasons they've been great for children

36
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:35,087
with autism for the theaters we faced
some

37
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:39,566
unique challenges that first for one
much I have a daughter then

38
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,730
is learning an app they might decide to
press the home button

39
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:48,302
and now the device is full distractions
so to address this issue

40
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,020
we create a guided access which the way
for our parents

41
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,700
for educators to keep the device in a
specific ap

42
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,056
when God actors at the naval

43
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,034
pressing the Home button where the lock
button have no effect

44
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:06,047
and so the child can have an
uninterrupted learning experience

45
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:11,124
free from distractions next let's look
at hearing

46
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,097
many users were hearing loss use hearing
aids

47
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:19,140
to help amplify the sound around them
but traditional hearing aids come with a

48
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:20,042
couple

49
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:25,093
issues first they require that you carry
are not with you

50
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:28,109
so that you can adjust the volume and
that can be cumbersome

51
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,053
and second call quality can be less than
after all

52
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,119
when using hearing it we have a phone
next to a hearing aid

53
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,051
you the hearing Fi's all the town
including

54
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,097
background noise or picks up the signal

55
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:47,115
from the phone electromagnetic field but
that signal can also be noisy

56
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:52,214
trading static so to address these two
issues

57
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,610
we partnered with hearing in
manufacturers around the globe

58
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:59,122
treat me for iPhone hearing aids these
hearing aid

59
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:03,291
connect directly to your iPhone and you
can do things like

60
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,340
adjust the following the hearing aids
without the need for a separate remote

61
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:10,683
in addition audio stream directly from
your iPhone

62
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,200
you're hearing aid so becomes
effectively a Bluetooth headset

63
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:17,151
and thats improves clock Ali
dramatically

64
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:21,390
finally let's look

65
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,410
at the broad area vision when the iPhone
was first introduced

66
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,700
many people were concerned that blind
users would not be able to take

67
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,400
advantage of its features

68
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,083
could do you think about it how do you
use a touch screen

69
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:39,027
if you don't see the screen it's going
to be difficult because

70
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:42,071
you wanna say really know what your
touching and you might accidentally tap

71
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,077
a button that you didn't mean to tap

72
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:48,086
so to address this we created Voice
number

73
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:51,184
when Voice number is unable you can
touch

74
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:56,373
anywhere on screen to hear what they
just touched before they take an action

75
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:57,195
like

76
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:04,789
tapping a button we also have
accommodations in our settings

77
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:09,560
for users with low vision who may not
necessarily need the full power

78
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:12,065
a voice-over for example some users

79
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,572
for for Boulder funds in which case they
can enable Bowl text

80
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:21,430
to get picture text some users may be
higher contrast

81
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,108
and if so we offer several options
including the ability to reduce

82
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,617
transparency on the system

83
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:32,714
and finally for users who are more
sensitive to motion

84
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,939
we offer reduced motion setting which
provides more subtle transitions

85
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,948
for example when you launch an app with
this notion enabled

86
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,880
crossfade interview

87
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:50,328
somewhat we offer I was currently to
support equal access

88
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,830
but we've been working hard and I'd like
to hide or some other new features were

89
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,165
offering an Iowa State

90
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:01,111
first guided access time limits

91
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:06,130
time limits are all about transitions
when a child is immersed

92
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,232
an app and then it's time to move on to
the next activity

93
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,295
that transition can cause some anxiety

94
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:16,658
with time limits a caretaker can assign
a specific amount

95
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,065
a time that a child should use an app
when the town is

96
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,710
almost reached the child receives a
warning helping them to prepare to move

97
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:24,750
on to the next

98
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,460
activity and when the time limit is over

99
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,145
the device locks next worrying Alex
Tyler s

100
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,584
summer you may have already met Alex but
for those who haven't

101
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:39,837
to let him introduce himself hi

102
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:44,167
everyone I'm Alex and I mean US English
voice

103
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,883
I've been living on Macs for years and
now

104
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,037
I'm excited to make myself at home on my
OS

105
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,680
to Alex will be available in all of our
assistive technologies that you speech

106
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:59,617
including voice-over speaks election

107
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:04,260
and a new feature introducing I was
eight called speak street

108
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,547
screen is great for anyone might have
trouble reading the screen

109
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:11,580
when it enabled you can do a simple
gesture or

110
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:15,063
ask Siri to speak the streams you and
advice will start reading whatever's

111
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:20,087
on street you also get options like the
ability to Paul's

112
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:25,610
rewind organ slow down the speech

113
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:29,550
and finally I'd like to highlight soon
someone you may have been using zoom for

114
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,270
years on I West

115
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:38,027
but we've reimagined I was 8 and add a
whole new way for you to interact with

116
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:43,466
but before I introduce at let's first
talk about what's the Indus currently

117
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,960
zoom magnifies the entire screen and
then use three fingers gestures

118
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:51,108
to navigate this approach comes

119
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:57,027
with a few issues first if you're using
three finger gestures

120
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,114
that means you're covering up a
significant part of the screen

121
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:04,251
especially on iPhones

122
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,461
also using free finger gestures mean
it's hard to use a phone

123
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,572
on the go you can't use the phone in a
single hand

124
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:14,550
you always need have one had to hold it
and the other hand to do three things:

125
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:16,152
gestures

126
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:21,281
finally typing can be tricky with you
enable

127
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:25,778
you have the choice between zooming in
on the content you're creating

128
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,800
or having access to the full keyboard
but you can't have both

129
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,497
at the same time

130
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,960
so to address all these issues for
introducing a new window

131
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,164
note for Zim and I like democrat to you
now

132
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:44,067
this is window too soon not only part
the screen

133
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,108
is magnified I can change what part
knife I

134
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:52,066
by dragging the edge at the window with
a single finger

135
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,995
I can also tap the edges the window to
get resize handles

136
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,664
so I can change how much the screen
night fight

137
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,520
if I tap on the a row at the edge in the
window

138
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,073
I get a menu with several options
including the ability to adjust my

139
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:10,106
Zimbio

140
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:15,055
now it's going to notes I would create a
new note and

141
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,654
watch what happens when the key or comes
up

142
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,193
Zuma no automatically got out of the way
the keyboard so I have full

143
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,601
access the keyboard but my constant

144
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,940
an ally tight

145
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:32,157
notice how the zoom into follows makers
are so I can always see what I just

146
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,119
typed

147
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:38,045
sadat some what we've been doing here at
Apple float

148
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:42,078
equal access for everyone but for the
second part of the story

149
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,083
we need your help I was is a great
platform could

150
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:49,046
all the app's you guys create and it's
up to you

151
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,084
to make sure that your abs can be used
by everyone

152
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:59,175
to that end I'll be showing you now how
you can do that with our API

153
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:04,077
utah real is going to be in two parts
first I'll show you how to add visual

154
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,110
accommodations

155
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:09,085
for users with different vision needs
and second I'll be showing you how to

156
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,103
implement some magic accessibility

157
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:16,006
sudden assistive technology like
voice-over can navigate your app

158
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:20,058
earlier in the stock showed some other
visual accommodations we offer i OS

159
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:24,061
for you to a different vision aids now
of writing API

160
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:27,127
see you can make those accommodations in
your app's as well

161
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,120
we have a way for you to detect whether
the user has all text

162
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:36,030
redo transparency starting colors or
reduce motion enabled

163
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:39,049
and that makes it really easy for you to
make specific adjustments

164
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:42,100
in your app for those users

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,089
suddenly show you how you can do that
now using a sample app we created for

166
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,165
this presentation

167
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,080
okay so first we're going to identify
some areas are ap

168
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:55,023
that need visual accommodations to do
that I've got my simulator

169
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:58,121
and I'm enabled several the
accessibility settings

170
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:02,105
in this case I got ball text reduce
motion

171
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:06,094
and underneath increase contrast I've
also got reduce transparency

172
00:11:06,094 --> 00:11:10,130
and dark colors that way when the
billion dollar after Xcode

173
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,095
we'll see what the user with those
settings we'll see

174
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:20,073
not going to Xcode and when I click on
building run

175
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:24,125
so this is a simple dating app at the
top you have the title the app which is

176
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:28,124
hello goodbye notice how the title is
very bold

177
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:33,036
and the background is fully opaque that
because we're using a standard

178
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:34,062
navigation controller

179
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:37,129
so we get the ball text and reduce
transparency behaviors

180
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,033
for free but because we're doing some
custom UI in our apt

181
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,132
there's still some work we need to do
you probably already noticed

182
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:50,094
how we have transparent overlays over a
photo background

183
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:54,179
when reduced transparency is on you
should really be making those opaque

184
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,093
in addition the text in the buttons
should be thicker because we have all

185
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,178
text enable

186
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,129
now going to click on the profile but

187
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,046
so here's where the user I can adjust my
settings

188
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:14,088
again we have the transparent overlay
and the text that should be bolder

189
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:18,166
at the bottom issue we have a preview
tap which I can slide up

190
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:23,083
to see how other users on this app will
see my profile

191
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,129
knows how my info is in great text under
each beheadings

192
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,033
when the user has dark in color enabled
it would be better if that text for

193
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:32,070
darker

194
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,137
to provide higher contrast against the
white background

195
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:42,071
now going to click on back and I'm going
to go into the match is page

196
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:45,102
so here's where I can see matches that
the app is adjusting for me

197
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:50,076
and I can say hello or goodbye to each
one

198
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:53,119
I want this guy's elevator pitch so I
want to say hello

199
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:58,060
and watch what happens when I swipe up

200
00:12:58,006 --> 00:13:01,010
noticed how the next match enemies
on-screen

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,088
as those coming from far away two dozen
example

202
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:08,097
an animation where we should provide an
alternate

203
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:13,105
for users who are more sensitive to
motion

204
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:18,104
and now let's do all this using the API
Xcode

205
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:22,032
to the first thing you're going to dress
in the text let's make sure that it's

206
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:24,041
thicker when bolt act is on

207
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,080
to do that I'm going to click on the
style utilities file on the left

208
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:30,079
which is where all our colors and fonts
are defined and then click on the drop

209
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:32,120
down to the top

210
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:37,009
to find our phat methods

211
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:40,049
years have both of these methods are
returning Avenir light

212
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:43,065
at the custom font now if we were using
the system

213
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:46,113
bond or the preferred font for textile
API

214
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:50,068
we would be getting Paul text for free
but because we expect

215
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:54,071
be picked a specific font two years we
also need to pick a fight to use when

216
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:56,072
Paul Texas enable

217
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:59,145
to do that I'd like to create

218
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:03,112
a helper method in the return the font
name

219
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:08,027
all we're doing here is first checking
your book butterball text is enabled

220
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:12,081
and it is we can return a thicker
version are fought

221
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:15,124
otherwise we can return the same but
we've been using

222
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:19,096
and now we just need to use our helper

223
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:24,131
you not to fun its

224
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,095
not take careful text now let's look at
those transparent overlays

225
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:32,191
I'm gonna click on the drop down at the
top and find where that transparent

226
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:33,189
overly color

227
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,101
is defined notice how right now
returning

228
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:43,040
eighty percent white when we do
transparency is enabled we should return

229
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:44,007
a 100 percent white

230
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:48,036
so we do that here

231
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:52,133
okay now let's make sure that the great
text in the profile preview

232
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:56,039
is doctor went dark in colors on to do
that

233
00:14:56,093 --> 00:15:00,162
and when I click on the drop down again
and fined for that colors to find

234
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:04,069
so here we just returning gray let's
first check

235
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:08,055
whether the user has dark in color the
naval and if so

236
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:12,101
weakening trend black instead

237
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:16,097
finally look at that zooming animation
we saw on a Mac cheese page

238
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:19,170
where the new match appears as though
it's coming from far away

239
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:24,054
to to address that I'm going to click on
the matches you controller on the left

240
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:31,115
now but open the drop-down and find
worry enemy the cards

241
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,020
no talk here resuming the new card
interview

242
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:39,093
now for users who have reduced motion
enable a better experience

243
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:42,115
would be to fade the card interview
because that animation

244
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:46,091
does not utilize a motion effect so

245
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:49,152
I'm going to create helper method the
phage the card interview

246
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:54,133
all we're doing is setting the Alpha the
card with animation

247
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:59,036
and that the point we would normally
issued card let's first check

248
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:02,107
whether reduce motion the naval if it is

249
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:06,012
we use our famous but instead

250
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:09,076
we can use assuming method for other
uses

251
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:15,090
K now let's build a runner after these
changes

252
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:18,036
here's our app again notice have a
transparent overlays are done

253
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:23,025
and have been replaced by opaque white
because reduce transparent even able

254
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:26,906
in addition the text in about as much
thicker

255
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,820
when I click on profile

256
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:35,083
again the same issues have been resolved
here I can slide up on a few tab

257
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,100
and now notice how my information is
darker

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,075
and higher contrast against the white
background

259
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:47,076
now and click on back and click on the
matches but

260
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:50,078
again I'm going to say hello to my
favorite match and watch what happens

261
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:53,111
when I do that

262
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:59,020
the next match page on to view because
we have reduced motion enable

263
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:03,010
so that's how easy it is for you to make
visual accommodations in your app

264
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:07,102
for users were different vision needs

265
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:11,681
next let's look at implementing semantic
accessibility

266
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,900
that boys are are users and switch
control user's

267
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:18,041
can also use your app

268
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:23,085
somatic accessibility is what allows an
assistive technology like by seller

269
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:27,314
to get information from a nap and to
control the app

270
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,124
doing things like tapping buttons are
adjusting sliders

271
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,900
here's an example assume at the
accessibility at work

272
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:41,045
let's say I've got the calculator app
open and voice-overs enable

273
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:45,069
when i touch on top of the five button
voice-over

274
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,123
intersect that touch and then asks the
app

275
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:52,108
what it has at that point

276
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:56,012
the app respond with an element that
represents the firefighter

277
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:59,857
and that allows voice-over to draw
cursor around the five

278
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,830
and to speak five so that I know what I
just touched

279
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,882
if I then decide to tap the five adn I
can do a double tap

280
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,668
anymore on screen and that tells
voice-over activate

281
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:16,350
the selected item so that's how
voice-over users

282
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:23,035
can use a calculator app

283
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:26,940
so how do you make sure that your app
for Savoy server in this way

284
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:29,963
as well well the good news is that

285
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,090
most demanding accessibility is already
built anti OS

286
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,032
so you get a lot of stuff for free but
you should still

287
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,131
audit your app with voice over on the
device

288
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,482
and there are couple questions you
should ask yourself

289
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:48,111
first can voice-over speak everything
that needs to be seen

290
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,692
second can voice-over do everything that
a user would want to do

291
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,610
now I'm going to be referring a lot to
voice over in the stop but all the work

292
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,124
for going to do in our apt also applies
to switch control

293
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:04,453
just keep that in mind

294
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:07,850
to some an audit your app for semantic
accessibility

295
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:11,014
I recommend that you go to your
accessibility settings on the device

296
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,830
and set your accessibility shortcut to
voice our that will allow you

297
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:22,295
to crypt triple click the home button to
quickly enable or disable voice over

298
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:27,912
if you never use voice over before here
are some tips to get you started

299
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,195
when you tap something that selects and
speaks

300
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:37,110
so for example in this screen if I tap
on the accessibility table cell

301
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:42,097
the cursor moves there and the device
speaks accessibility

302
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,148
if I double tap anywhere on screen that
%uh boys over to

303
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:50,367
activate the selected item so in this
case if I did that

304
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,960
accessibility table cell would get
pressed and we were moved accessibility

305
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:57,169
page

306
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:01,073
when I swipe to the right that selects
and speaks

307
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,688
the next element right now the back
button is selected

308
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:11,850
so if I tried to the right the
navigation title become select

309
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,764
and finally when you have a ScrollView
you can use three finger swipes

310
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,830
to scroll so I want to see more the
accessibility settings

311
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:26,083
i cant three-finger swipe up just roll
down by page

312
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,955
for that all you need to know to do an
audit of your own apt with oyster

313
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:34,600
and now lets show you how he knew that
with our sample app

314
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:37,065
so here they're dating app running on
the device when I triple click the home

315
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,097
button

316
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:42,159
boys over on for sorry company

317
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:46,018
the first then we'll do with ask
ourselves that question can voice-over

318
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,554
speak everything that needs to be seen

319
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,054
to first I'm going to tap on the title
at the top

320
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,240
hello goodbye heading okay so voice-over
can see that

321
00:20:56,024 --> 00:21:01,403
now let's touch on the logo

322
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,360
it's kinda quiet but that sound you just
heard means that voice-over doesn't

323
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,295
think there's anything under my finger

324
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,230
so it looks like most other users won't
be able to read this logo

325
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:15,202
now I'm gonna tap on the Profile button
profile

326
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,447
button and literacies that when I swiped
right

327
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,850
at select the next outlet so I do that
matches button

328
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:25,435
water finds a match but if I select the
right

329
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,960
one more time we hear that sound with me
there's nothing else

330
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:33,110
after the salomon which is correct in
this case so it looks like this view is

331
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,780
in pretty good shape except for the
missing logo

332
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,881
now what did happen profile profile

333
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,962
button and when a double tap activated
profile

334
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:48,730
profile back back button let's wipe the
right a few times

335
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,502
to see what boys overseas profile

336
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,164
heading your age nineteen percent

337
00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:00,667
adjustable swipe up or down with one
finger to adjust the value

338
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:03,828
tonight a little strange we just heard
your age

339
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:07,672
followed by nineteen percent it would
make a lot more sense

340
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:11,070
if voice-over said the age here which is
actually 37

341
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:14,926
and the instruction set a swipe offer
down to adjust the night

342
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:18,100
so I swipe up watch what happens 28
percent

343
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,170
by a jumping up by 10 years

344
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:24,480
so it doesn't look like bush ever users
will be able to set their age

345
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:27,207
accurately right now in our apt

346
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,731
now I'm going to strike the right if you
are times to see what else was overseas

347
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,690
47 copies

348
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:37,808
music swing dance wine text field

349
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:42,330
double tap to edit let's make sure that
moisture users Canada two hotties

350
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:46,033
so I'm a double tap text field is
editing

351
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:49,842
music swing dance wine and people came
up

352
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,187
so that looks like whatever users will
be able to do that

353
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,621
let's just make sure that the Done
button which appeared in the top right

354
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:59,663
is also visible to voice-over salt app
on that

355
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:04,907
done button and it is I double tap

356
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,360
that it has added editing so it looks
like my hobbies are in good shape

357
00:23:09,036 --> 00:23:12,815
and the elevator pitch field is very
similar hobbies so we'll skip that

358
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:17,176
for now now I'm gonna touch on the
Preview tab at the bottom

359
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:21,582
preview so it's just saying preview

360
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:27,257
and if I couldn't see the screen without
visual indication a cab

361
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:31,600
in Miami clear to me what this does I
mean I might try to double tap it

362
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:34,103
and so when I do that preview nothing
happens because

363
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:40,406
this tab doesn't respond to attack in
needs to have a slide gesture up

364
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,966
the right now bush ever users cannot
preview their profile

365
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,392
now I'm gonna touch on the back button
back back button

366
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,466
and double-tap hello goodbye heading

367
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,931
I'm a tap on matches now matches button

368
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,314
and double-tap matches matches back

369
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:01,814
back button okay again we're gonna swept
the right a few times

370
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,600
to see what voice overseas matches
heading

371
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:08,895
swipe up their own to say hello slide
down a road to say goodbye

372
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,494
Alexis okay that's also a little strange

373
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,996
on visually when you look at this logo

374
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,134
are thus label you see swipe up to say
hello

375
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,855
but voiceover saying swipe up a row to
say hello

376
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:26,960
not because voice-overs reading each
other's characters literally

377
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:30,184
so it would be better if voice-over
described as in a more natural way

378
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:34,753
now a swipe to the right to get to the
photo gauge

379
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:41,587
except we didn't get to the phone a now
to try touching it directly

380
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:45,320
and again I get that sound which means
whatever doesn't think there's a voter

381
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:47,371
there

382
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,682
now some are you might be wondering
whether that even import

383
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:57,450
you after all voice our User doesn't see
the photo right

384
00:24:57,045 --> 00:25:00,133
but you're not is important so for a
couple reasons

385
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:05,082
first on a voice-over user using this
app I need to know

386
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:08,401
that other people in a sap can see my
photo

387
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,155
even if I don't take full advantage to
the photo it's important to know that

388
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,382
it's there

389
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:16,950
and second remember that semantic
accessibility is not just about

390
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:16,814
voice-over

391
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,693
so it's always a good idea to expose any
meaningful info

392
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:23,993
from your app okay now wanna touch I

393
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:27,761
age again age

394
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:30,871
and one swipe to the right a few times

395
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:34,950
parties 32 cooking bubble tea with
friends

396
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:37,324
travel you're paying close attention

397
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,480
you may have noticed how boys are went
from age

398
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:44,117
to hobbies and then back to 32

399
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:48,561
so when you're looking at the visual
layout at this profile card is clear

400
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,740
what this means but moisture users are
often

401
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:55,445
swiping to to the different elements
because that can be easier than

402
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:59,840
touching exactly where an element is and
so it's important

403
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:03,122
have a logical order for how the
talented

404
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,351
it's also important for switch control
user's switch control

405
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:10,690
the experts control cursor will move
from element alman

406
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:14,248
in the same order and it's important or
defeat predictable

407
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:19,908
so that a switch control user can
activate the switch at the right time

408
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:24,730
okay lasting remember that our second
question was

409
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:28,160
can voice-over do everything that needs
to be due done in asap

410
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:32,575
the prior to the match is pages so allow
users to say hello

411
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:37,202
or goodbye to the matches but more so
for years

412
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:40,586
won't be able to do this right now
because swipe gestures

413
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,432
get intercepted by voice sir and when
you provide a different way

414
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,074
for moisture years to do the same
actions not the kinda process you can

415
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:48,815
take

416
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:53,970
with your own apt to see whether it is
semantically accessible

417
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:57,120
now let's look at resolving those issues
beyond countered for someone to

418
00:26:58,002 --> 00:27:00,841
introduce the most basic accessibility
API

419
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,040
there are only two properties here and
he remember nothing else from the stock

420
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,144
please remember these two just by using
these two property

421
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:13,003
you can solve a lot of accessibility
issues

422
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,087
the most important property you need no
is the is excess Billy Allen property

423
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,531
this is the boy in that determines
whether a view is visible

424
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:27,663
to voice-over by default returned yes
for standard UI controls and labels

425
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,950
which is why even though we haven't done
any semantic accessibility work

426
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:35,914
in our apt yet a lot of the text is
already visible to voice our

427
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:40,781
and a second most important property you
need to know in the accessibility label

428
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:41,901
property

429
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:45,032
this describes love you and by several
speak this

430
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:50,332
when a voice over your touches on a view

431
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,460
if you train your views and Interface
Builder you can set the property

432
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,125
directly from Xcode you I

433
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:00,590
on the right hand side Xcode you'll find
an identity inspector

434
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,968
and there's an accessibility section
there the accessibility

435
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:09,320
enable text box corresponds to is
excessively and

436
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:15,391
and the label field correspond to access
Billy label

437
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,850
if you creating your views in code it's
still really easy to set these

438
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:18,157
properties

439
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:23,116
as shown here

440
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:26,820
so now with look at using these two
properties

441
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:30,911
and see how much more accessible we can
make ap it's the first thing

442
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:34,690
we're going to do and make sure that
whatever users can read the logo on the

443
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:37,071
first page

444
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,191
to do that I'm going to go

445
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:43,570
click on the Start controller on the
left which is where

446
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:46,886
and we create that lip I'm gonna click
on the drop down

447
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:50,600
and find our view did learn math

448
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:53,465
to hear the lookout just image right now

449
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:57,105
and first we're going to set is
exceptionally Alan to yes

450
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,615
so that voice-over can see it then we
also need to make sure voice-over

451
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,567
describes it correctly

452
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,361
so we give it and accessibility label in
this case we're just going to give it

453
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,630
but expect inside the lookout notice
also that were local I'd in a string

454
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:17,308
because voice-over speak in many
languages

455
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:20,720
next let's make sure that the photo that

456
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:23,651
in the profile card can also be seen by
voice

457
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:28,307
do that I'm going to click on the car
review class on the left

458
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:33,393
and I would over the drop down to find
where we add our profile views:

459
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,597
so here's we're adding the fire again we
set it just really element PS

460
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:41,570
and we get inappropriate access Billy
label

461
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:46,134
in this case we're just gonna call it
profile photo

462
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:51,083
filing let's look at the instructions
for saying hello or goodbye

463
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:55,042
right now voice-over is saying swipe a
row to say hello

464
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:59,100
let's fix that so to you that I'm going
to click

465
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:02,890
on the matches you can chill are on the
left and organ open the dropped out of

466
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:03,840
the top

467
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:07,633
to find where we add those fighting
instructions

468
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,395
so here's the label that says
instructions

469
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:14,998
it's already inaccessibility element by
default so all we need to do is change

470
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:18,340
the accessibility label

471
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:21,057
we're going to give it one that is just
like the tax on the label

472
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:28,057
except for replacing those unico que
rose with words

473
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:34,160
now I'm going to build and run the app
with these changes

474
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,822
extras folder to Abes double tap to open

475
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,127
hello goodbye extras folder to aP's

476
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:49,033
double tap to open

477
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:52,278
hello goodbye

478
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:57,587
here half again with these changes the
first thing I do is touch the logo

479
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:03,960
hello goodbye meet your match image now
voice-over users can read this

480
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:06,107
next time wanna touch on the matches but
matches

481
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:10,066
button and double-tap

482
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:13,133
matches back back button let's first
look

483
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:17,531
at what the instructions say right now
so I got to say hello

484
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:21,600
slide down to say goodbye guess that
much easier to understand

485
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,077
and now when I swipe to the right
profile photo

486
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:30,278
image voice-over is able to see the
photo in the profile

487
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:33,664
so that's how you do with just these two
properties already made

488
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:37,350
other partner accessible

489
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:40,804
but because we got some more custom UI
in our apt some additional

490
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:47,200
API will need to use to give voice our
users a really great experience

491
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:50,953
first I like to introduce the concept
accessibility treats

492
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:54,255
trace describe the function I love you

493
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:59,940
for example in the familiar timer app
each other we all the time

494
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:02,273
had the trait up adjustable and that
means that

495
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,080
its value can be changed up or down

496
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,027
the start button have the trade a button

497
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:16,192
and that gives the user a hint that this
is something that can be activated

498
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:20,086
again if you're creating your views
Interface Builder is really easy to set

499
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:20,670
the street

500
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:24,393
directly from excuse you I in the same
section we talked about earlier

501
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:29,460
you'll see a bunch of checkboxes for
traits somebody check boxes may already

502
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,105
be checked

503
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,568
in which case I would definitely
recommend leaving the salon

504
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:40,830
but at check boxes next to trace that
you think are important for you

505
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,542
encoded also straightforward to set the
excess Billy trace

506
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:48,470
but just remember that it is a bitmask
so if you want to at a trade

507
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:51,326
in addition to others use a bitwise or
operator

508
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:56,847
as shown here to combine them

509
00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:00,743
next let's talk about accessibility
value

510
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:03,877
excessively value is a string on
properties so in that way it's similar

511
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:06,210
to accessibility label

512
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:09,920
if you use accessibility value for
things that are dynamic

513
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:14,122
for example uses on views that have the
adjustable train

514
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:17,720
to describe a numerical value

515
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:21,241
right now in our ap the H latter had an
accessibility value

516
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:25,952
nineteen percent that's a case where we
can override accessibility value

517
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,595
to return the age instead

518
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:37,318
next we'll talk about actions to actions
are how voice-over can control your app

519
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:42,706
to really common ones Rd internet and
document actions

520
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,320
to the reaction that are associated
specifically for views that have the

521
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:47,321
adjustable chain

522
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:53,330
and they allow the user to increase or
decrease an element's value

523
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:57,302
again in our apt a fly to right now can
be in Trenton or decorated

524
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,618
but right now it's doing that by ten
years

525
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:07,789
we can overriding netted to allow the
user to change your aid by a single year

526
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,193
another really important action is the
activity action

527
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:15,503
and that's what happens when a user
double taps normally when you double tap

528
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:17,260
something that just

529
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:20,079
taps the view but you can override this
method

530
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,081
argues that respond to a specific
gesture and I we wash our users can do

531
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:25,098
that action as well

532
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:28,182
easily for example in our apt we can use
this for the Preview tab

533
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:34,158
which currently only response to a
sliding gesture

534
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:38,100
and finally we have notifications which
a liar

535
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,084
app to tell boys are when something has
changed one really important

536
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:43,100
notification is

537
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,609
the lab change notification should you
should send this

538
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:53,638
when you're changing the layout oh yeah
for example adding or removing years

539
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:58,420
for example in our app right now when
you revealed a preview

540
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:02,114
washer/dryer might not realize that new
elements have come on stream

541
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:07,037
once you post a lab change notification
more server checks to find

542
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:12,121
the elements that are there currently

543
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:16,086
now we've put all this together in our
sample app to resolve some more those

544
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:17,102
issues we encountered

545
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:21,016
so the first thing we're going to do is
make sure that Bush every year's

546
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:24,024
can editor H to do that

547
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:29,140
I'm going to go to Xcode and click on
the each letter class on the left

548
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:33,030
here let's override accessibility value

549
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:36,151
now when you can return the age instead
of a percentage

550
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:41,066
all we're doing is taking the value fire
which corresponds the age

551
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:44,118
and making it into a string

552
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,022
next let's make sure the boys are users
can add

553
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:52,103
or remove to the range by was single
year

554
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:57,021
so to do that with override excessively
entrant all are doing here

555
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:00,080
adding one decided value we also send

556
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:03,105
the value chains controlled and now way
other parts were you I'd that

557
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:09,114
rely on the sliders value can update
accordingly

558
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:14,039
we do the same thing presently document

559
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,090
and now one nuance to this after these
changes

560
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,078
are each slider has all the information
that the user needs to know

561
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:27,086
namely the user's age so from a semantic
accessibility standpoint

562
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:30,173
that label showing up next to the slider
is redundant

563
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:34,074
and Mike even be confusing so

564
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:37,122
just hide to do that

565
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:41,047
I'm going to click on the profile the
controller on the left

566
00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:47,114
and open the drop-down to find where we
add that label

567
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:54,050
to hide it we simply set it successfully
element to know

568
00:36:54,005 --> 00:37:00,016
okay next let's make sure that bush ever
users can preview their profiles

569
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:03,080
to do that let's go in Xcode and click

570
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:06,047
on RP label class

571
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,086
so here's our roadmap for this we're
going to override accessibility activate

572
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:14,102
on the preview label so that we can
control what happens when the user

573
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:16,057
double taps

574
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:19,153
but we need to tell the profile
controller to show or hide the previous

575
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:20,149
civil me away

576
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:25,067
to communicate that to do that

577
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:28,078
let's set up a delegate protocol

578
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:32,104
an almost dark purple had a single map
in ever going to call when the labeled

579
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:35,008
acted

580
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:38,064
course we also set up a dog property so
that

581
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:41,069
you can color can set up a delegate

582
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:46,022
now let's go to the implementation file

583
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:49,080
here going to override excessively
activity

584
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:53,073
all we're doing is leading the delegate
no that the labels activity

585
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:59,057
and we return yes to indicate that the
action succeed

586
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:03,091
while we're here but also at abutment
rate to the preview label

587
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:06,137
and that way Bouchard users will have I
will have a hint

588
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:10,079
that they can double tap acted

589
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,087
to do that I'm bored override
excessively traits

590
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:18,112
and first for calling super to get any
treaty would have by default

591
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:22,034
then we use the bitwise OR operator

592
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:26,040
to combine that with the button tree

593
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:29,061
okay now let's go back to our profile
you can chill or

594
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:32,142
to implement the delegate protocol

595
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:37,047
so for someone to scroll to top it off
I'll and declared that this you can

596
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:37,133
chill or

597
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:42,089
implants that article next I'm going to
open the drop-down

598
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:46,093
and find where we at that preview label

599
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:49,099
to the view here

600
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:53,112
we've set but you can tailor as its
delegate

601
00:38:54,012 --> 00:39:01,012
to finally let implement that protocol
my scroll to the bottom

602
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:04,097
and here we implemented the only
delegate protocol method we have

603
00:39:05,078 --> 00:39:09,133
so when the preview labels acted will
first check whether the previews

604
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,078
currently showing

605
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:16,151
if it is we can hide it otherwise we
reveal it

606
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:21,062
one additional thing recall that when
you hire sure the preview

607
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:24,110
you're changing the layout at the screen
so we should tell voice-over that's

608
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,008
happened

609
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:29,027
to do that let's go to implementation
have revealed card

610
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,101
and dismiss card I'm gonna click on the
drop down to the top

611
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:36,104
and find those two methods

612
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:40,100
both these methods are enemy in the car
honor of spring

613
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,016
in the completion for that animation we
post lab change notification

614
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:51,034
miss do the same thing down here when
dismissing the preview

615
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:58,034
okay now is building an app with these
changes

616
00:39:58,071 --> 00:39:59,149
hello goodbye

617
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:03,123
double tap to open extras folder

618
00:40:04,023 --> 00:40:07,069
to aP's double tap to open hello goodbye

619
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:11,458
okay so here we are in the apt without
changes for signs have on the Profile

620
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:12,510
button

621
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:16,139
profile button and I'm going to double
tap to activate profile

622
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,228
profile back back button first

623
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,430
let's touch on the age lighter 37
adjustable

624
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:27,192
swipe up or down with one finger to
adjust the value

625
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:31,650
tonight at us much clearer we're
actually seeing the age now

626
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:34,754
and when I swiped up to adjust the value
38

627
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:39,460
it goes up by a single year when I
select the right

628
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:43,695
copies notice how we've skipped over
that redundant label to the right

629
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:47,650
now I'm going to touch on the pre tap

630
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:50,127
preview button this time

631
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:54,042
because its editor button I know I can
do something with this

632
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:58,116
song on a double tap preview and not
have a preview appears

633
00:40:59,016 --> 00:41:02,020
so much like to the right profile photo
image

634
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:05,661
I conceive stuff inside the preview if I
tap on

635
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:08,877
see you again preview button and
double-tap

636
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,041
preview that hide the previews so I
checked the right now

637
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:18,133
I hear that sound most ever knows that
the preview has gone off street so

638
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:19,650
that's how we can make

639
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:26,065
even custom UI accessible to voice to
resolve the last remaining issues we

640
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:29,089
encountered during our audit we're going
to use a new API

641
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:35,818
added in Iowa State first let's talk
about the UI accessibility container

642
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,270
protocol

643
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:40,126
something you may already realized that
that isn't new

644
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,437
but we've updated and I'll 8 to make it
much easier to use

645
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:49,020
for those who are familiar with this
protocol you access Billy container

646
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:52,040
is a wage paternalistic cessna Lee Ellis
for love you

647
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:57,038
you need to do this if you have elements
not correspond to views

648
00:41:57,074 --> 00:42:00,169
for example you might have a view with
the drying it

649
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:04,117
and you might want different parts for
the drying to be separate accessibility

650
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:05,686
allen's

651
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,970
in that case you would create an
exceptionally element

652
00:42:08,097 --> 00:42:11,104
for each part the drying and returned
those elements using

653
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:16,506
the UI testily container protocol and
you can see last year's talk

654
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:22,700
for a great example how to create your
own elements but what many people don't

655
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:22,106
realize is that

656
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:26,074
this protocol is also a great way to
return existing allen's

657
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:30,067
in a specific order so for example

658
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:34,166
if voice-over is navigating things in a
different order from what we want we

659
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:37,093
cannot use this protocol to return those

660
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:40,093
element in the or that we want bush over
to see them

661
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:46,117
and now for what's changed

662
00:42:47,017 --> 00:42:51,094
so currently in order to use this
protocol there are three methods

663
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:54,117
you need to override you know I was 8

664
00:42:55,017 --> 00:42:58,100
there's a single property call
accessibility elements

665
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,069
which you can set to return a list

666
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:05,146
the talents and notice how now you don't
need to override some class

667
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,000
and you don't have to deal with three
separate methods so we think people are

668
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,009
going to find that much

669
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:14,066
easier to use Big Pimpin

670
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:18,123
next up we're introducing a new

671
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:24,039
class called the custom action you
should use custom actions when you have

672
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:26,018
more than one action for an element

673
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:30,200
for example in the app switcher

674
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:33,101
each ap thumbnails can you to be tapped
to launch the app

675
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:38,102
or you can slide up to close the app and
some

676
00:43:39,002 --> 00:43:43,321
we expose a custom action for closing
the app and now a voice-over users can

677
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:44,680
do that action easily

678
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:49,227
without needing to do the sliding
gesture in our sample app we can also

679
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:50,841
use this API

680
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,960
to allow water users to say hello or
goodbye to the matches

681
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:59,143
the custom action class looks like this

682
00:44:00,043 --> 00:44:03,142
you create a custom action object for
the name

683
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:07,520
that moisture uses to describe it and
you also given a target

684
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:11,611
and a selector so similar to what you
would pass to you I but and that

685
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,107
determines what happens when the action
is performed

686
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:18,630
once you create a larger custom action
objects

687
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:22,077
you can assign them to love you using
the accessibility custom actions

688
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:27,119
array property now let's use this

689
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:31,098
in our apt to fix the remaining issues
first

690
00:44:31,098 --> 00:44:34,121
we're going to do is make sure that boys
are navigate

691
00:44:35,021 --> 00:44:38,640
the use in the profile card in the
correct order

692
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:43,150
namely we don't want to go from age to
hani's and back to 32

693
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:49,474
to fix that was click on the car view
class on the left

694
00:44:49,609 --> 00:44:52,658
here's our method worry at all the
profile views: when I scroll to the

695
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,950
bottom

696
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:57,164
after all OVR sub you haven't read in we
can set the

697
00:44:58,064 --> 00:45:01,150
accessibility element property a park
argue to an array

698
00:45:02,005 --> 00:45:05,344
%uh its abuse any order you want them to
appear

699
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,839
notice how I put the age title right
next to the each value

700
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:16,075
okay next

701
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:19,184
let's make sure that whatever you just
can't say hello or goodbye to the

702
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,750
matches

703
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:25,944
to do that I'm going to click on the
match if you controller on the left

704
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:30,619
first let's find out what we're doing
when a user swatch offer down without

705
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:32,730
voice-over enable

706
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:36,122
someone a click on the drop-down and
find our swipe gesture recognizer

707
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:44,022
handlers to put these cameras are simply
calling into math is called say hello

708
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:49,046
and say goodbye and which are
implemented by the pup

709
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,665
these methods are also great candidates
for the selector that we pass

710
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,510
to the custom action objects the only
thing we need to change

711
00:45:57,051 --> 00:46:01,055
it make sure that they return booleans
to indicate whether the action sixty it

712
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,176
in most cases you can just return yes

713
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:08,147
now one more thing when you say hello or
goodbye

714
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:12,055
to a match the layout changes so again
we're going to post

715
00:46:13,027 --> 00:46:17,091
only at change notification both these
methods are calling into a helper

716
00:46:17,091 --> 00:46:20,092
call animate cards for hello which is
implemented

717
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:24,290
read about

718
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:27,306
so in the completion for this animation

719
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:31,470
we should post are we have change
notification

720
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:36,176
okay so that's how to set up a need now
let's create those custom action objects

721
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,960
I'm going to click on the drop down to
the top

722
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:43,755
and find where we add to cart to the
matches page

723
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:47,930
to hear a credit card and were

724
00:46:47,093 --> 00:46:51,282
assigning swipe gesture recognizers to
it

725
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,133
alongside the swipe gesture recognizers
but now create our custom actions

726
00:46:56,259 --> 00:47:01,288
for someone to create an action for
saying hello

727
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:04,710
here's how that works we give it a name
which in this case

728
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,980
is simply say hello we pass in the view
controller

729
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:12,662
at the target and a selector we pass in
the method that we just modified

730
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:16,940
to return a boolean we do the same thing

731
00:47:16,094 --> 00:47:19,189
for saying goodbye now

732
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:23,148
we want the user to be able to say hello
or goodbye wherever they are in the

733
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:25,637
profile card

734
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:30,490
so for every element in the car view

735
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:33,338
ruinous set it successfully custom
actions poverty

736
00:47:33,779 --> 00:47:38,790
to an array of these two actions

737
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:45,079
okay now let's build and run with these
changes

738
00:47:52,024 --> 00:47:52,119
double tap to open

739
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:57,037
hello goodbye hello goodbye

740
00:47:57,037 --> 00:48:00,116
okay what happened matches matches

741
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:04,020
button and double tap to activate
matches

742
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:08,018
matches back back button to the first
thing I'm going to you

743
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:11,135
is top on the photo and starts wiping to
the right to see what order Voice

744
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:13,086
oversees the talents

745
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:16,140
profile photo image age

746
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:20,015
32 copies cooking

747
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:23,056
bubble tea with friends travel not much

748
00:48:23,056 --> 00:48:26,079
easier to understand next let's touch

749
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,164
any element in the profile card in this
case I'm gonna touch on the photo

750
00:48:30,064 --> 00:48:33,102
and listen to what it says profile photo
image

751
00:48:34,002 --> 00:48:38,056
swipe up or down to select a custom
action so we're given the option to

752
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:39,131
choose when the actions we created

753
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:45,039
when I swipe down say hello I hear the
description of the action

754
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:51,083
if I want to take that action I can
double tap now butcher users

755
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:56,087
can also say hello or goodbye to the
matches not how easy it is to use the

756
00:48:57,023 --> 00:48:57,102
new API

757
00:48:58,002 --> 00:49:05,002
we've added and I was aid so we kinda
talked and Bartok

758
00:49:08,093 --> 00:49:13,158
and there if you take away that like you
