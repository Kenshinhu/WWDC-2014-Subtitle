1
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:18,038
welcome

2
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,023
welcomed in green some great games

3
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:26,070
where talk about today how is something
that you can do in your game to make it

4
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:29,216
really really great but having a fun
game

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,040
is simply not enough there are things
that need

6
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:36,083
great games do at what I mean is games
the recognizes

7
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,742
industry-leading in the games industry
things that they do that you should be

8
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:40,542
doing

9
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:44,041
but we really need to be doing to make
your game great

10
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,120
and is a massive opportunity have him
talk about yesterday

11
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:53,033
there's 75 billion download an
application

12
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:57,051
and as everyone in this room knows shoot
for sure those

13
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:01,053
our games games are also reinforces this

14
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:07,118
but the 130 million monthly active users
last month that that is a huge audience

15
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:13,036
you can tap into for your game but and
to do that you need to start with a

16
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:13,103
great idea

17
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:17,086
obviously putting up hard work and you
need to follow some

18
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:21,109
reeling really your important key tips
to make your game great

19
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,017
so over the last couple days

20
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:29,110
yesterday and this morning we talk about
technology and their technology like

21
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:34,043
Open GL ES 3.0 which was introduced
since WWDC last year

22
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,145
and is the most advanced Open GL out bps
out there

23
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:42,056
we also have met all are low-level
highly optimized

24
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:45,215
GPUs PRI we've Game Center which
provides

25
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,720
that focal connection for your players
spray kit think it

26
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:54,770
you let us do the heavy lifting for you
if you don't need to go right OpenGL

27
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:54,159
metal

28
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:58,158
you can use my kitten think it ill allow
you

29
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,020
to do less programming and left left
without a fish in API on

30
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:05,059
underneath your game and game
controllers open your game up

31
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:09,086
many forms have in place of course is
also Xcode sex

32
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,123
was swept and playgrounds we have

33
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:16,074
tools like the open the metal for OpenGL

34
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:19,653
seen a Open GL debuggers we have

35
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,520
think it and Sprite kid editors and also
this week we have

36
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:27,109
mass amount of sessions about games we
have three on metal

37
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:31,035
we have 21 think it to on on Spike it

38
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:34,074
we have lab all all these technologies
all week

39
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:37,163
and we have sessions about development
tools but

40
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:41,069
technology alone is not enough you can't
just be

41
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:45,056
take the technology build the game might
have been expected to be successful

42
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:49,065
you have to go about the gains business
and the business to building a game with

43
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,061
the same passion

44
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,068
you would go about your game design for
choosing your technology

45
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:58,087
or your graphics API if you look at the

46
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:01,088
though winners from the Apple Design
Award

47
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:04,136
last night like three leo's fortune

48
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:08,040
device sex black are Monument Valley

49
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:11,160
they have some common traits that
attract engage

50
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:16,057
and retain their players anything gave
me is key to success

51
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:21,055
so we find our there are some common
thread

52
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:24,140
among the successful games things like
make it easy to buy

53
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,006
and play your game with by reducing the
friction

54
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:31,025
or refresher content to

55
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,143
continually a a be able to retain any
Gators players I said engagement is

56
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:36,130
really key

57
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:41,036
even invite these in other trade among
these games

58
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:44,071
and I like by Allen Schaeffer up on
stage to talk about

59
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:51,080
these key ingredients for a great games
fair

60
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:57,015
hello everyone welcome to BBC 2014 games

61
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:01,161
so my name is Alan Chi for I'm a game
technology evangelist at Apple

62
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:06,084
and as jeff said I'm here to talk to you
about some other things that we

63
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:09,090
see in from the best games on iowa's now

64
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:13,051
there's a lot of things that go into
making a great game

65
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:17,500
and a lot of different ways to describe
that process right attack go back to

66
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,820
what he was saying

67
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:22,097
we look at games we think about the
Apple Design Award winners over the

68
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:22,796
years

69
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,930
we start to see common thread some kind
of key ingredients that all these games

70
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,172
get right

71
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,047
and that's what I want to talk to you
about today so

72
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,472
I'm gonna go through ellipse I have some
of these things that just really stand

73
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:38,340
out to me there is a lot more

74
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:41,893
than what I'm gonna go through but here
is my the first thing on my list

75
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,830
okay is to remove friction

76
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:49,131
so i'm talking here about making a great
first impression

77
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:54,034
and I really frictionless first time
experience in the game

78
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:57,073
really streamlining everything

79
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,379
that gets in the way of the player
getting into the game as they start

80
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,454
so what do I really mean by friction
here so here's a

81
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:09,280
are imaginary game how many as 3,000 it
is awesome by the way

82
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:12,071
I'm but did have some other problems
with friction

83
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:15,130
that I'm thinking up here so let me show
you first the startup experience have

84
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,082
this game

85
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:21,330
player comes then loading

86
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:24,622
so yes still loading and it's going to
take about a minute to load because

87
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,710
that's how long it'll take me to get
through the slides so

88
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,270
you know the problem that I have or that
I see here

89
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:35,830
with a number of games is that they
really take i neva monolithic approach

90
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,412
to loading their assets and they preload

91
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:43,225
everything up front instead of you know
trying to just do what they need just to

92
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,888
get started

93
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,577
so your goal should be to get
interactive as quickly as you can

94
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,310
load just enough of your assets so we
can get up and running to your first

95
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:55,630
interactive screen

96
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:59,006
and the new technologies like Grand
Central Dispatch and so on to move work

97
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,580
of a beer main thread

98
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:04,111
high and so inlet that continue a
synchronously

99
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:10,180
then also use the time profiler to
really take a look at your loading

100
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,550
performance

101
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:15,514
I'm and it'll show you and a lot of
detail exactly what worked the app is

102
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:16,074
doing

103
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:20,738
during that time but even before you get
into the time profile I don't want to

104
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,770
just punted time for Oprah profiler is
my advice

105
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:27,656
you have to really think about it first

106
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:32,080
right why are so many things being
loaded up front

107
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:35,027
in isn't there something that could be
deferred

108
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,180
and made AC and loaded a synchronously a
a little bit later

109
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,982
but okay so it's downloading and now
let's go on

110
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,330
to our downloading some assets

111
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:51,038
okay so I'm you know a lot of you guys
do this in the game and it's fine it's a

112
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:56,062
you in many cases it's a good thing but
it doesn't have to be in something where

113
00:06:56,809 --> 00:07:01,825
it makes the player wat so later in the
talking and I go through a couple other

114
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:06,080
things that you can do to move this off
to the side so the user doesn't even

115
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,987
have to notice it

116
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:11,370
okay next registration

117
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:14,546
when I like a pattern mania coun no

118
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,879
I would like to play paddle mania I'm

119
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,941
so you know when you think about the
registration

120
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,516
there's a couple possibilities here you
know maybe actually

121
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:28,930
that registration is needed maybe you
have us

122
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:32,202
game that is server backed and you need
some way to uniquely identify this

123
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,040
player

124
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,610
if that's the case then actually you
could just use the vendor ID that we

125
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:39,840
provide to the game

126
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,389
as the unique identifiers for that
player and get it so that it's out above

127
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:45,870
the players way

128
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,856
handle it automatically may be the case

129
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,673
isn't that you have a server back a
maybe you're just asking the user to

130
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,013
sign up for an account because you want
to

131
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,396
given new server special offers are just
whatever they're the reason maybe

132
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,125
well the first time experience in the
game is not the right time

133
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,476
ask for this yet they don't know who I O

134
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:11,722
you know why you might be asking so of
course you would need to clearly explain

135
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:12,833
it like is the mediators

136
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:16,634
just have extra and if it's not

137
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,108
really needed been differ in till later
so

138
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,763
I wanna play how you say no thanks

139
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,074
Mac shut configure my paddle with paddle
mania

140
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:32,990
I'm but still let me be clear you know
if this is my first time playing the

141
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:32,170
game

142
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:37,014
then I don't know the implications are
many these choices right as to go and

143
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:37,155
play

144
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:44,055
so if they matter then now is not the
time to ask me because I don't know

145
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:48,088
and if they don't matter then don't put
him in the way of the user getting on

146
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,667
board into the game

147
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,480
and you know not better knowing either
way sort of conveys to the players that

148
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:56,136
is not

149
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,073
really the experience your hand really
been thought through

150
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,116
so there's some real trouble with powell
mania actually

151
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:09,305
mm yeah there we go the last one here
please leave a rating

152
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:14,110
I'm you know this is fine right way we
talk about this all the time

153
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,035
I but you know at this point actually

154
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:20,110
I haven't even played the game yet so
you know now is not the best time to

155
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,004
come and ask me about rating and

156
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,049
I'm but I you know I think you guys are
getting at here right so

157
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:29,061
let me give you the takeaways this first
section so you've got to get the player

158
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:30,107
into the game

159
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:35,106
reduce the load time and any blocking
updates to get the game interactive

160
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:39,895
as quickly as possible them streamline
the registration

161
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:44,420
right provide an escape from tutorials
and long intros and all those things

162
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,044
that might get in the way

163
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:51,067
and I don't forced decisions about
something that the player can possibly

164
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:55,906
I know about yet and be patient no show
some restraint when you're asking for

165
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,630
feedback

166
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:03,105
so that number one remove friction from
the first time experience

167
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:08,094
K years number two to be a good teacher

168
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:11,993
so be it a good teacher is really all
about thinking through that on boarding

169
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,680
experience and really kinda making it
fun

170
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:18,087
cuz if you can help your players get I

171
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:22,246
get started it's more likely that
they'll become more deeply engaged into

172
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,100
the game

173
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:27,089
and you know it's almost easier to think
a bit on the other side

174
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:30,191
if you just leave it to the player to
figure out your game

175
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:35,010
themselves then you run a lot of risks
the risk people

176
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:38,970
just being a couple times and getting
frustrating

177
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:43,266
leaving the game or maybe no missed
something that was really important

178
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:47,940
to the gameplay and would have captured
the interest but they just didn't see it

179
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:51,142
they didn't know to go down that path so
yesterday during the design awards

180
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,131
ceremony john was up here he talked
about Leo's fortune

181
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:58,170
as his example I am use a different
example

182
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,240
I ending I'll Apple Design Award winner
from 2011

183
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:06,293
and that's cut the rope so this was up
of fun puzzle game

184
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:11,370
and spread a perfect example here to use
as a as on board in case study

185
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:15,556
so right away what you see here is that
they're using coaching tips to explain

186
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:15,958
the goal

187
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:19,654
which is to deliver can't eat on on the
character

188
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,428
and then they start to tell you about
things like the primary interaction

189
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:27,730
can cut the rope you swipe with your
finger to cut the rope

190
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:30,682
now you might be looking at this time
going like was totally obvious

191
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,362
but now it's only because you've seen
this picture I

192
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:39,627
had so the you know what people would do
without this they were tapped the candy

193
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:43,720
they were tapped on nom trying to get
him to jump up and eat the candy they

194
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,086
don't know what to do

195
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,137
and those aren't the right interaction
site the correct one is to swipe

196
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:51,124
cut the rope so than once

197
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:55,097
the player has that down then they start
introducing new interactions one at a

198
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:56,026
time

199
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,480
so each time is another coaching tip are
so here you cut the rope

200
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:04,087
the book they can be flows down it goes
into the bubble and in the bubble will

201
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:05,166
start to lift it up

202
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:10,130
and then there's another tip put writing
context once that happens

203
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:14,602
telling a player to pop the bubble with
her finger I embattled

204
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,935
release that and it'll come down to Tom
not

205
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,272
can't and then one more

206
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:26,433
really sort of subtle thing is that a
big part of the game play in Cut the

207
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:26,886
Rope

208
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,350
comes from I'm trying to get the candy
to touch all the stars

209
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,041
are before it gets down to on and

210
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:39,260
kinda routing it around that way in to
be successful at that usually take some

211
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,620
trial and error on every level

212
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:44,511
when you actually playing again so it's
actually

213
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:48,110
really important to the core loop in
this game

214
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:51,087
to show players how they can try again

215
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,106
right so in their onboarding they call
that out

216
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:59,022
specifically and you think oh it's just
know okay fine they're showing me around

217
00:12:59,022 --> 00:12:59,951
the buns

218
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,220
but now if they had left that to the
player to discover on their own

219
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:07,641
some people might not have played around
with all the buttons and menus to

220
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,862
to go and play again for really pisses
cord to the gameplay

221
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:14,240
so that's why they should

222
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:18,543
but okay so to summarize now so start by
bringing the player

223
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,785
right into the game and show them how to
get started

224
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,030
and then introduce more complex
interactions one at a time

225
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:31,230
provide camps in context as you go along
and then help them discover the things

226
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:35,047
that will be important in the game as
they as they play through it

227
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,110
that number to be a good teacher now I
want to mention also I'm we're having a

228
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,110
related session

229
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,296
it's gonna be on Thursday very aptly
named making a great first impression

230
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,084
was strong onboarding design will spend
a whole hour

231
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,920
going through some examples that really
get this right so be sure to catch that

232
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,097
on Thursday

233
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,097
alright now I want to turn focus to the
gameplay itself

234
00:13:57,097 --> 00:14:02,006
the number three is to really tune and
perfect your corlew

235
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,885
you know I talk to people all the time
and people asked me to

236
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,008
to take a look at their game give me
some feedback you know stuff under

237
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:09,720
development

238
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:12,371
and a lot of times what I'm looking at
is something you know they're they're

239
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,025
saying I just

240
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,060
it doesn't really feel fine yet and what
that really comes down to is the core

241
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,645
lid

242
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,910
so Corluka is a term that wraps up how
to describe the game mechanic in terms

243
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:24,166
are

244
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:30,067
know the actions the player takes in the
game the reward that they receive

245
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,068
BR as they're pursuing the a goal

246
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:37,847
I and the resulting expansion of the
game or the growth the character

247
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,515
I as that motivated them to pursue that
reward

248
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:46,019
and just in games that aren't quite
right what I often find is that there's

249
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,000
some disconnect

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,037
in this cycle or sum mismatch between
the parts

251
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:54,376
so they don't really lineup well but so
when we just

252
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:57,753
illustrate this by showing you some
typical examples from from different

253
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:58,930
genres

254
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:01,161
just set the stage so you're here is a
fantasy role-playing game

255
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,073
I explore the the dungeon I

256
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:09,116
I fight enemies defeating the enemy is
gets me treasure and experience

257
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:13,029
am and I use that treasured experience
to

258
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:17,188
to level up and to buy things and then
that lets me go and fight more more

259
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,480
powerful enemies

260
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:21,049
okay very clear for platformer

261
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:25,438
you know the basic idea platformers a
running jump okay that's player action

262
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,881
but their goal is really to complete the
level itself into

263
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,904
avoid all the obstacles in the bad guys
in collect the stars are power ups or

264
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,680
whatever is happening on that level

265
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,777
but then if you're successful the
expansion is to unlock

266
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:43,500
the next stage literally expand the
universe the game universe for that

267
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:46,284
for that can and where then you then
going fine

268
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,800
new things to run and jump over new
obstacles and so on

269
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:54,096
but okay so now to get a little deeper
you know it's really worth noting

270
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:58,099
that summer the most compelling games
are the ones

271
00:15:58,099 --> 00:16:02,358
with more than one corlew and I'm
showing the side by side

272
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:06,294
but really they're meant to be
overlapping I'm so you're fighting

273
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,720
monsters you gain experience you
leveling up but at the same time

274
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:14,001
you're collecting clues you using the
clues to solve a puzzle

275
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,120
the puzzle led to all market or behind
the door there's more monsters the more

276
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,012
clues and

277
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:25,015
these are overlaid in the experience on
top of each other

278
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:29,073
okay so let me give you some more
concrete advice here so

279
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:32,112
know what really is the bottom line him

280
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,832
so the best games I've first are the
ones that really

281
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,434
I clearly understand their target
audience

282
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,818
and are able to put Center excuse me put
the centerpoint

283
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:47,470
a big corlew right on top of that
audience

284
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:50,844
and it's important that the core loopy
easy to expressing kinda be easy to

285
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,050
understand that's kinda

286
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:56,664
when I find games that that are have
these little mismatches

287
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,770
usually it's a case where it's difficult
for the developer tax and to express the

288
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:07,332
corlew these components clearly in terms
the action the reward expansion

289
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,790
now as I've been saying make sure each
basin this

290
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,478
feeds right into the next in sort of all
the energy that the player gives into

291
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:16,214
one part of it

292
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,550
flows around kinda reinforces the other
parts

293
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:24,414
make entered each iteration meaningful
and I'll talk about this will more as I

294
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:24,984
talk about

295
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:30,960
progression in the game I'm but then
also questioned your assumptions and

296
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,102
this is probably even

297
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:36,661
best advice for a developer sister go
back and really rethink innkeeper

298
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:36,752
iterating

299
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:41,470
until you know it you've done it well
and

300
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:44,132
you know how do you know how do you
really know he I could say play task but

301
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:45,120
thats

302
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:49,981
that's just a punch right it is like how
do you really no

303
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,350
that you did it well well you know it

304
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:56,052
by really thinking it through yourself

305
00:17:56,052 --> 00:18:00,075
you know if you find the clues will you
be able to solve the puzzle without some

306
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:00,084
giant we for

307
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:06,109
we buffet or going online to Google how
to figure out this puzzle

308
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:11,057
well you know if you on walk something
would if you solve that puzzle is it

309
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,072
going to unlock the next stage

310
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,911
if you unlock the next stage while I
have something new or novel to really

311
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:17,620
look at

312
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:22,194
once I get there K to test it

313
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,360
but at the same time don't feel boxed in
I am NOT saying that every game needs to

314
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:27,045
follow

315
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:31,075
the same design methodology or I'm

316
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:34,620
you know kind of deal with its audience
in the same way

317
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:37,971
a lot of the really best expressions of
I've great games

318
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,720
are the ones that aren't afraid to mix
this up I'm

319
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:44,661
but so now let me show you just a a
quick example

320
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:48,900
I a game this really fantastic in a way
that doesn't score lou

321
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,768
is Apple Design Award winner last year
this is ridiculous fishing by playing

322
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:53,320
beer

323
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:57,761
I'm so it really has I think you could
break it down into three distinct

324
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,050
mechanics

325
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:02,070
the first one is when you are dropping
the

326
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,096
your line into the water you're just
trying to you're using the accelerometer

327
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:08,104
the gyroscope in trying to get the wind
down through the water

328
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:12,485
avoiding the fish get is deep as you can
okay then

329
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:18,100
once you run out of line or once you hit
a fish on the way down

330
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:21,210
everything reverses and now you're going
back up

331
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:25,500
and reeling and as many fish as you can
were back on the Giro

332
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:29,037
again and just trying to now to collect
as many other fish in try to run into

333
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:29,086
them

334
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:34,039
while avoiding the jellyfish in other
bodies that are better there

335
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,076
and then the third loop when we get up
to the surface

336
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:42,109
of course I'm we fooling the fish up
into the air and the new cap on them

337
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:47,058
to shoot them out of the sky right so
and collect points

338
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:51,007
and so AM in those points are white we
use to expand

339
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:55,340
as the expansion in the game we let's
get a better Leuer

340
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:59,223
longer lines and so on so the game is
really you're hilarious

341
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,900
and he didn't see it last year from the
design awards check it out

342
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,084
but so that's tuning your core loop

343
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:11,454
now let me expand out from there I am so
for the next few

344
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,490
parts for the talk I wanna go through
some aspects of this next ring

345
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,868
around the core lou I want to start with
the interaction mechanic

346
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:22,408
I'm because obviously you know how the
player interacts with your game is

347
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,348
completely fundamental to the success

348
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:30,110
on the core lead to a feeling fine and
if your players seem to be having

349
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:33,098
trouble with the controls this is where
to start

350
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,160
and is to design for touch

351
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:40,033
so sometimes when I'm working with
someone who's bringing a game over I

352
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,102
west from another platform like

353
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:48,131
a PC or console or whatever their first
instinct is actually to just bring their

354
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,130
core loop over completely unchanged

355
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:54,282
yeah including all their old interaction
mechanic

356
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,860
right and so you know if the game was
based on pressing buttons then they just

357
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:01,098
overlay the screen superimpose some
buttons

358
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:04,107
or if they used to use the d-pad then
okay great

359
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:09,061
and open a virtual d-pad on the screen
but the truth is that this is usually

360
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:09,139
not really

361
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,568
optimal these overlays get in the way
and the player

362
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,840
seeing the game field and but more
profoundly

363
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:21,553
their indirect their control that are
controlling that little Patil its gonna

364
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:22,860
go

365
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:25,905
underneath and and you know so bouncy
ball game right

366
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,110
and so you since the indirect

367
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:33,062
it relies on the player to really be
able to be in control

368
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:37,070
up the controls themselves but they
can't feel when their finger is in the

369
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:40,085
right spot and therefore so they kind of
have to look at their finger allied

370
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:44,110
in order to be confident in their
actions

371
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:49,014
okay now if you step back for a moment
and really think about where all this is

372
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,602
coming from

373
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,868
you know if the game was designed with a
different interaction mechanic in mind

374
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,740
then a lot of the assumptions about
other mechanic

375
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:01,263
just get built into the game may become
have implicit

376
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:06,720
and ultimately kinda for gone and when
that happens

377
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:10,031
the answer isn't is unjust to retiree
map

378
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,330
some controls on to a virtual joystick
virtual buttons

379
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:18,602
you really need to go back and re think
those assumptions

380
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:23,250
and yup go back and redesign for touch

381
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:26,057
and if you're not sure what I really
really mean by this then let's just go

382
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:30,119
back and look at some other design award
winners over the past couple years

383
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,075
Monument Valley tap the PAP and that
directs ida

384
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:37,124
around to walk around she's main
character in menu

385
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:42,583
or you you do the float with gestures
and that'll turn the crank soon move

386
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,270
beyond the walkways

387
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:47,085
so it's based on taps and gestures

388
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:50,087
black you make a shake with your finger

389
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:54,246
and that's the pattern that the stroke
this generated is going to follow

390
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:58,850
you try and get that to repeat and and
try to hit the dots

391
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,099
by the way I'm gonna hang this picture
in John's office when we get back

392
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:06,038
so but it's about stroking a pap

393
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,935
three games so in 30 push the trials
against the walls to make

394
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:16,220
no matching numbers I join together in
very kind of physical you're pushing the

395
00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:16,096
tiles

396
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:20,165
they're coming there's squeezing
together against the walls and so on

397
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:25,066
but it's all based on short strokes and
swipes

398
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:29,580
Infinity Blade you swipe the screen just
control how your character is going to

399
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,407
swing a sword

400
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:34,020
then there's some buttons you press to
dodge

401
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:37,075
I'm and there's ever race you put on
your user shield

402
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:40,075
I'm and there's some gestures he used to

403
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:44,364
to cast the spell was so it's taps
swipes

404
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,950
and gestures cut the rope we just showed
you use swype to cut the rope and then

405
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:49,189
you tap

406
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:54,102
things like balloons and you tap on the
bubbles and so on to

407
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:58,911
to blow a rounder pop the bubbles so
it's taps swipes

408
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:03,750
where's my water you guys are getting
this you know you take your finger

409
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,076
you drag your path drag have through the
dirt

410
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:10,774
and that's where the water is going to
flow so you feel your finger touching

411
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:12,480
the glass you

412
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:15,497
instantly get audio feedback when you

413
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:19,470
when you touch the screen you feel the
friction

414
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:22,386
as you withdraw that path move your
finger around and you

415
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:26,833
instantly see the path you drew so it's
a game against

416
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,054
everything right everything is in think
so

417
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:34,549
let's take all the same sort of distill
it down and summarize what I mean by

418
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:35,570
this

419
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,150
so the key to what that pic all those
games and others

420
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:44,042
the nerd all doing is to design their
controls around direct interactions

421
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:48,506
reinforced by instantaneous feedback

422
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:53,337
so direct manipulation is the key to
that interaction model on Iowa s you've

423
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:55,784
got to embrace the idea

424
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,720
that the best i OS games are the ones
where you reach

425
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:03,126
through the glass in touch the game
elements themselves

426
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:08,050
right so it's based on touches and
perhaps in gestures and swipes

427
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:11,027
and panning and drawing pads where

428
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:15,136
those interactions are the ones that
define the gameplay

429
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:19,063
and then it's critical that you provide

430
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:24,069
instantaneous feedback so these are the
visual cues and audio cues so that what

431
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,036
you see

432
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:31,063
and what you hear and what you feel all
reinforce what you did

433
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:34,109
and they reinforce each other

434
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:38,010
okay so with all that passion

435
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:41,023
now has designed for touch

436
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,111
but the people seem to be having a lot
of trouble with your control

437
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:50,060
then go back to those principles and
really redesign your core luv around the

438
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
idea of direct interactions

439
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:56,011
that are reinforced by instantaneous
feedback

440
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,071
okay next to foster in gage mint so

441
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:03,119
you know this is about keeping the
player coming back onto your game and we

442
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:06,112
use a lot of different terms to describe
this

443
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:11,821
you know it's a huge a huge area but all
this is done because just hopefully

444
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:16,340
you know having a really deeply engaged
player is gonna generate word of mouth

445
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,099
and viral discovery

446
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:20,186
more business for you more of a fan base
and so on

447
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:24,150
and there are a ton of things to talk
about here but

448
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:28,040
on yeah I know get to some specifics in
a minute

449
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:31,634
but i wanna first say something else
it's a little deeper

450
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:37,474
about this so it's really easy for any
of us to kind of get

451
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:43,500
wrapped up in the details of the Corluka
me on boarding and so on

452
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:47,424
but its it's important for you to be
able to rise

453
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,850
above those details the game and really
see the game from the players

454
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:53,134
perspective

455
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:57,099
and understand that the design process
here

456
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:01,788
is profoundly fractal the same patterns

457
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,738
amor chat every level would detail and
there are resonances

458
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,510
among them so even if you get big game
loop completely right

459
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:16,110
if you can't rise above that it won't
resonate with your medicaid career

460
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,076
progression

461
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:21,094
if you get the progression ride but you
can't rise above that

462
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:26,150
it won't resonate with the storyline and
so on and so on

463
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:30,284
but OK so now taking this down a notch
back to her

464
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,832
just a moment I'm you remember how a
couple love

465
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:37,720
moments ago I i said that you know a lot
a really interesting games

466
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:42,073
overlay multiple core loops well that
holds true for the progression is well

467
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:46,120
and so one way that you can really get
hold the players interest is to provide

468
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:50,031
layers of progression or overlays a vid

469
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:54,055
I've progression and expansion with
multiple goals model perhaps some goals

470
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:55,058
I mean

471
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:59,074
multiple paths have challenges and
different pasa

472
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:03,363
giving different a balance between risk
and reward

473
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,590
that's something the players will find
very very compelling

474
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:11,094
you can even game of ID expansions
themselves

475
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:14,823
so this is the opening the essence of a
lot of crafting games

476
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:18,755
is the you make the expansions
themselves into choices at the players

477
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:19,538
have to make

478
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:25,438
that our strategic to the future of
their gameplay and then in you ensure

479
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,594
that you take them down different paths
depending on I what they've done

480
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:35,274
but OK this next one now so this is
particularly important for anyone who's

481
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:37,480
making free to play games

482
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,857
and after provide value for everyone
both you're paying players

483
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:45,870
and your non paying players so work
through

484
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:49,006
the entire experience for both those
audiences

485
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:52,852
and to ensure that those who are playing
your game for free

486
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:56,420
can can progress can expand

487
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:01,940
and sure they can see the benefit show
them the benefit becoming a pain player

488
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:04,683
but if you try to force them then you're
losing gauge min

489
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:08,607
with a fair number and on the other side

490
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,345
ensure that those who are paying in your
game

491
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,080
I'm will feel that they're getting
properly rewarded in the game and

492
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:19,477
getting something for the money that
they're spending

493
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,690
the next candice is holding the players
interest

494
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:26,082
so really do what you can to incentivize

495
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:30,541
repeat play so enable and motivate the
players

496
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,750
to try one more time enable and motivate
the player to see what's next

497
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,120
enabling motivate to see how it ends

498
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:43,029
right and if you think about where the
spirit again

499
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:49,063
one more try is about the core loop see
what's next is about the progression

500
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:54,069
see how it answers about the storyline
right

501
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:58,928
K now let me talk about on a bit about
reengage min

502
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,648
so providing really you know coming out
and providing relief

503
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,690
fresh new content out after you launched

504
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:10,438
is a great way to keep your momentum
going and in many cases he meant to draw

505
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,064
help drive new growth

506
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,110
to really think about how you will
continue your story

507
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:22,038
to provide new content or new levels are
new goals are challenges and so on

508
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:28,039
worth seasonal content around holidays
or regional content in different locales

509
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:31,627
it's all good give your players are
another positive reason to come back

510
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:33,142
into the game

511
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:39,090
and it's important that you plan this
out before you launch

512
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:43,022
because the people who have had
catastrophic success

513
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:48,034
are the ones who a game takes of in the
realize people are done

514
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:51,046
and they need to scramble to get more
content out

515
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:55,108
your most engage players are going to
are going to consume your content very

516
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:56,957
quickly

517
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:02,340
so habit ready have it ready to go so
that you're really deeply engage players

518
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:05,110
can have something that's gonna bring
them back into the game and you attract

519
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:09,420
new players to come in as well

520
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,600
now it's also important to really
measure and understand how well your

521
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,012
retaining your players

522
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:18,091
I'm in starting later this fall in will
be providing

523
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:22,094
a retention information to you through
iTunes Connect

524
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:25,149
so this is gonna show you how many
players have downloaded your game

525
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:29,448
by day by region by platform by

526
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,894
stores and what percentage to them kept
playing in the days that followed

527
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:39,480
that their download and so this is just
a takes

528
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:42,049
okay so we'll show you a lot more about
this

529
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:46,054
I in the iTunes Connect session tomorrow
morning

530
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:50,518
so that's number five to foster
engagement

531
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,110
so now let me turn the focus the other
way and get into a couple things on the

532
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:56,059
technical side

533
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,135
and so this is number sixty use
background transfers

534
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:04,744
I'm okay so you remember back in their
first section where I was talking about

535
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:08,120
friction I talked about downloading
updates and I said that that was

536
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:11,706
something that we can move out at the
players wait that's what this is about

537
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,090
more or get into here

538
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,013
so in Panamanian 3,000 we have no

539
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,133
thousands have image assets because we
have so many levels right we have

540
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:26,072
and for all those different different
assets we have one for retin-a

541
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:29,911
non retin-a iPhone 5s iPad iPad air

542
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,470
right now we have all bar sounds ACN mp3
for our soundtrack we've got linear PCM

543
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:39,226
for for audio effects with opening L

544
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:42,880
we've got thirteen different
localizations right

545
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:47,117
so English French your a pig's Japanese
traditional chinese Simplified Chinese

546
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:50,630
brazillian Portuguese in a few more

547
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:54,075
IM and we have a binary compiled three
different we are three ways

548
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:57,244
rb7 rb7 as an arm 64

549
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,870
kept so a lot of stuff in power maybe
three thousand

550
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:05,386
I'm and you know putting all that
together is putting us over the limit

551
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,233
for downloading over cellular so what he
did

552
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:14,846
well I'm you know a lot of times a
discussion will begin

553
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,730
and you know quite often will be
somebody who will chime in with advice

554
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:20,272
like this

555
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,937
one-size-fits-all just ship one star is
stretchered

556
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:29,097
stretches to fit on all the platforms
order shipped one localization they all

557
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:32,080
speak English right

558
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:35,024
now they really don't I'm

559
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:39,025
so don't sacrifice quality and don't
shortchange

560
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:44,174
your Global Audience realize that what
you could prop you could probably get

561
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,486
your game under a hundred megabytes if
you use background transfers

562
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:51,274
you and let the user download the main
bondo love it now

563
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:55,330
but have more content that gets
transferred down after they've run at

564
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,112
the first time

565
00:33:57,012 --> 00:34:01,701
so was a couple things to do is now so
the first step is Roy to take a good

566
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:04,340
fall look your gaming the game design

567
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:08,080
and and determine if there is some
content that isn't really needed right

568
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:12,024
up front you know I'm games especially
games with any kind of a linear

569
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,315
progression

570
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:19,210
are perfect for this right you put the
first couple of hours or whatever you

571
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:21,024
know the first 20 30 levels

572
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:24,203
in the bond a lab for quality MN

573
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:28,190
that's gonna provide enough time for the
user to be playing and then you

574
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,026
use background transfers to download the
rest while they're playing those first

575
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:33,120
twenty

576
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:38,054
so houses dot okay so an issue I L
session is an API that we introduced

577
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:39,098
back in Iowa 7

578
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:44,123
I and its the uses to upload and
download data from your own server

579
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:48,132
and this is intended for large datasets
so

580
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:52,720
game levels big images sound files
Tech's route was is all that kind of

581
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:52,691
thing

582
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:56,348
right now the transfer itself happens

583
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,530
outside of your process you just set it
off your kid

584
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:03,602
notified when it's completed the player
can continue or the app can even be

585
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,750
termed no quitter terminated and the
download is gonna keep on going

586
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:12,090
map if its running all be notified or
it'll be woken up

587
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:16,065
I'm when the transfer is done and it's
just enough so that you can take the

588
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:18,115
content thats been downloaded

589
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:23,224
and kinda unpack it and put it into its
permanent location

590
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,230
so it's really useful it does obviously
and add some complexity

591
00:35:28,023 --> 00:35:31,026
right cuz you're gonna have to handle
some corner cases now

592
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:34,115
he didn't have have before like the
player running out of disk space

593
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:40,031
or are now reaching a level that you
have been successfully downloaded the ad

594
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:43,116
I'm and it's important also that you
follow the Iowa State a storage

595
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,019
guidelines

596
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:48,066
I'm so these will tell you exactly where
to play

597
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:52,075
any downloaded assets and also remember
this is about

598
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:57,114
assets no new textures new levels
newfound and I kinda thing

599
00:35:58,014 --> 00:36:02,453
but not code if you're making code
changes that has to go back up through

600
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:03,410
our preview

601
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:07,450
as an update to the app but a case that
number six

602
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:12,680
to use background transfers and you know
if you're going to be targeting I was 7

603
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:15,467
and above like now is the time right
because you can move

604
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,460
cleanly up to are all appear supported

605
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:23,122
devices with a and if you were all
session

606
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:28,022
K number seven optimized graphics
performance

607
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:31,046
so you know I mention I meet with
developers all the time I probably met

608
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:32,124
with some other people in this room

609
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,055
I am yet to give people feedback on
their games I

610
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:41,074
about one of the things that just very
very honestly that I love to do

611
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:44,142
I is to run their game through our
performance tools

612
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:50,054
kinda views that too figure out I what
optimizations they need to be may

613
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:53,129
me to make in Open GL and so on describe
what I eat for breakfast

614
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:59,063
right I'm now so as I get into this
section though the first thing to

615
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:00,155
realize in to say about it

616
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:04,084
is dead optimizing graphics is

617
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:09,520
totally white matte all is all about but
or get a medal in a second

618
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:12,057
I want to talk first just about
optimizing the games that are already

619
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,096
out there

620
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:17,141
so you know every game is different
right and

621
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,130
most remember actually a pretty well
optimized are okay

622
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:26,009
are but in the games that are having
performance issues with OpenGL

623
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:30,058
it's usually because for some portion to
the frame at least for maybe all over

624
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,040
the frame

625
00:37:32,004 --> 00:37:36,062
they're trying to do a lot of draw calls
with a low number of triangles to be

626
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:38,174
processed in each draw call

627
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:42,163
and the worst case scenario isn't

628
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:47,180
is actually fairly common I i see it
sometimes there is particularly

629
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:50,067
in 2d and isometric games that I'll find
the sometimes

630
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,716
is that they're just there in a loop
where their binding a texter

631
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:58,010
drying acquired and then repeat blind
drop by drop on dry and that's how they

632
00:37:58,001 --> 00:37:58,570
draw

633
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:02,800
their entire scene with one draw call
for every quad

634
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:05,027
want extra fine for every draw call

635
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:09,990
and you know for OpenGL yes there's just
there's a fair amount of CPU overhead

636
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:09,173
that their

637
00:38:10,073 --> 00:38:14,075
the that's involved here in the
validation in the processing draw calls

638
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:18,149
I'm so you know the theory behind this
is it becomes very important for

639
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:23,068
to optimize the state's it's super
important that those developers

640
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:28,090
find a way to amortize that overhead
over more triangles

641
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:32,090
I'm now this is something that I can
help in your view with or are

642
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:36,142
in will we have you know times are
people in the lab this week so if you're

643
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:39,042
falling into the situation

644
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:44,045
I'm we can help you Wed these 15
recommendations that are up here cover

645
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:46,714
most of the cases but I run into this is

646
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,800
the solutions that we apply depending on
the the game depending on the

647
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:55,080
the structure and how other what they're
doing an open GL

648
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:59,121
but and I'm not going to go deep into
any of these but so

649
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:03,022
more broadly what you need to realize

650
00:39:03,022 --> 00:39:07,069
is that optimizing graphics former
performance is really

651
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:10,156
in primarily about identifying the
bottlenecks

652
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:16,315
that you have MN addressing them taking
some action to address them

653
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:22,210
okay so bad lets me talk about the tools
you know we have these fantastic tools

654
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:26,900
that will help you identify exactly
where your performance bottlenecks are

655
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:30,990
indifferent bottlenecks that might be
happening so this is a screenshot from

656
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,171
the Jeep you perform in scraps in Xcode

657
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,129
I'm and the this along with the Jeep you
frame to bugger

658
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,090
in Xcode and be open gles analyzer
instrument

659
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:44,012
are kind of the tools of the trade you
should familiarize yourself with here

660
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:47,148
was so now a museum in so what you see
here

661
00:39:48,048 --> 00:39:52,065
section at the talk you see this sorta
speedometer on the left up to the top

662
00:39:52,065 --> 00:39:56,014
the purple bars with utilization in the
in the middle that showing my GP you

663
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,060
utilization man over here on the right
frame time

664
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:04,039
I how much time the CPU is working on
this frame and how much time the GP was

665
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,118
working on his friend

666
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:09,687
now in this particular screenshot it
would

667
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:13,270
this is a little different than what I
was just talking about with pine drop by

668
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:14,041
drop by drop

669
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:18,074
I'm in this one what it is I can see the
renderer utilization is that a hundred

670
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:18,953
percent

671
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:22,664
and that's pushing the device
utilization up to 100 percent

672
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:27,450
and that is typically a sign actually
have a very expensive fragment shader

673
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:32,069
okay and so down in the bottom here you
can see I i love you here now

674
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:35,248
I'm where I can is showing me the cost
of eat

675
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:39,010
%uh everyone to buy shade urs that was
used this frame

676
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:44,070
and I can turn down these disclosures
and see the specific draw calls that use

677
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,104
that cheater and how much

678
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:49,210
each one of them cost as well and then

679
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:53,180
I can also go and drill down into a
particular shade or I'm not gonna walk

680
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,030
you through all

681
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:59,042
Buri but once you get to the view where
you're looking at your shade urs

682
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:03,210
facing bad in again

683
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:06,076
K XO know what this is showing me now
look at on the right hand side

684
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:11,102
these little bars this is is taken live
from the device is able to see the

685
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,341
performance data

686
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,750
and its in its going line by line
through the shooter to show you the

687
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:18,104
performance costume each line

688
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:22,783
and so here I feel that okay 59 percent
on the cost

689
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:26,170
on this shade her was going into shadow
projection

690
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,078
and there's probably something I can
optimize I can use a lower resolution

691
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:29,867
shuttle now for something

692
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:33,621
because remember this was the most
expensive cedar

693
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:37,920
in the app and the renderer utilization
was at a hundred percent

694
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:41,731
so this is this is the bottleneck the
shadow projection and so it's exactly

695
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:42,910
what

696
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:46,127
in this case needs to be optimized out
but so the point though is that the

697
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:51,072
tools can be used to exactly pinpoint
what's going on in your app

698
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:55,431
I'm now you know if you're not familiar
with a tool or this isn't

699
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,200
this isn't something that you know your
way around the edges come down to

700
00:41:59,002 --> 00:41:59,071
collapse

701
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:02,278
we have so many people down there who
would love to help you out

702
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,920
to sort this out was so obviously
there's an opportunity here

703
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:09,175
right for open till yes based games the
kind of use the tools

704
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:14,138
optimizing get better performance but I
also want to be super clear

705
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:18,071
you know that seeing so many developers
struggle

706
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:21,097
I and Phase these kinds of issues are

707
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:25,114
a big part of the reason why strike it
and sink it were developed

708
00:42:26,014 --> 00:42:30,473
right their purpose is to provide you
with the capabilities that you need

709
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,470
right cutie

710
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:34,686
games who I was bright kid 3d games with
scene kid

711
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:38,540
are now they can be mixed together right

712
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:42,076
but they real key is that once you're
using them taking revenge about

713
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:45,435
their feature set they take on the
burden

714
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:51,640
I've rendering optimally in Open GL and
you don't have to worry about anymore

715
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:54,155
and if you think about it one more step
you know since

716
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:58,061
apple provides the entire technology
stack from

717
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:02,984
these API's all the way down to the
hardware

718
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,550
it means that everything can be made
very often more

719
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:09,624
in a way that you don't have to work on

720
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,380
and then okay speaking about optimal
right

721
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:17,497
now there's mad 0 right so this this is
for those who view

722
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,180
with games are engines that need to push
a lot more draw calls

723
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:26,054
and really allow your code to have a
very efficient

724
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:30,105
access to the GP you to interleave
graphics in Comput

725
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:34,564
and so on and really take control
yourself over how the frame

726
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:37,890
is being rendered so that his number
seven

727
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:40,798
optimized graphics performance

728
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,130
okay number right now we're lifting out
at the tech in just a couple

729
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:48,024
really kind of quick and light it some
advice here

730
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:52,095
on this is a real super quick one is to
make a great gameplay video

731
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:55,224
notes or earlier in the talk I talked
about the important to making really

732
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,710
great first impression

733
00:43:57,071 --> 00:44:00,680
well wide web didn't really get into
then was that from the pot users

734
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,460
perspective your player's perspective

735
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:06,104
all about is gonna start on the App
Store and

736
00:44:07,004 --> 00:44:10,049
you know as we talked about yesterday
you know when people are really coming

737
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:13,638
onto the App Store they're looking for
something that's cool in New

738
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,220
you know they're going to be looking for
some way to kinda understand what your

739
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,045
team is doing and you want

740
00:44:20,045 --> 00:44:23,051
to have something that's going to stand
out and

741
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:27,128
and exactly explain it and so that
they'll be more confident in

742
00:44:28,028 --> 00:44:31,066
and more ready to to get your game

743
00:44:31,066 --> 00:44:34,092
okay now as we talked about a little bit
yesterday so in Iowa

744
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:37,155
8 I was tenuous amity you'll be able to
create the short

745
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:41,604
ap previews for game previews to demo
your game

746
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,460
you should use this to show how the game
is played you know you did

747
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:49,104
tell a story with this and and really
appeal to what makes the game play so

748
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:51,026
much fun

749
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:54,089
you know here's how it'll look when it's
on the app on this App Store

750
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:57,175
we show this a Monument Valley example
yesterday

751
00:44:58,075 --> 00:45:01,134
I'm and how it works is that just the
app review just

752
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:06,750
appears as the first I first image there
along with the screenshots

753
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:09,138
user taps on that they can see this
gameplay video

754
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:13,053
but now some details about this okay

755
00:45:13,053 --> 00:45:16,842
so good the app review needs to be to a
video of your gameplay

756
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:21,320
it's not intended to be an ad it should
convey the real

757
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:26,770
experience in playing the game it can be
up to 30 seconds long

758
00:45:26,077 --> 00:45:31,406
you provided as the H 264 %um pick for
encoded file that you upload into iTunes

759
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:32,980
Connect

760
00:45:32,098 --> 00:45:36,153
you can have for you should have a
different video for iphone

761
00:45:37,053 --> 00:45:43,068
verses iPad I'm and your content itself
can be captured directly of a pure IO

762
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,076
West device

763
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:47,415
i an on your Mac that's running I was
ten years somebody

764
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:51,670
the Mac to see you thought I was devices
a video camera

765
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:54,148
and you start playing the game and you
can capture it using whatever to you I

766
00:45:55,048 --> 00:45:56,080
QuickTime Player

767
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:59,103
I and so on iMovie is where you can do
your editing and they just put it all

768
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:01,104
together and get it up on

769
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:05,043
iTunes Connect you're ready to go

770
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:09,107
mm this is really just sort of one piece
building a great

771
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,510
App Store presence rights are having a
great

772
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:16,094
icon compelling screenshots
localizations

773
00:46:16,094 --> 00:46:19,101
description two keywords and so on

774
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:24,024
UK so about app review there's a whole
session on it's also on Thursday

775
00:46:24,024 --> 00:46:25,047
afternoon

776
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:28,055
a check your schedule to see that

777
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:31,072
and make a great video this gonna show

778
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:36,169
players who were interested in your game
a what what the gameplay is really like

779
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:40,228
K number nine to localize

780
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:43,850
you know the App Store is a global
business

781
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:47,520
it's available in all 155 countries in
40

782
00:46:47,052 --> 00:46:50,074
languages right service this is a

783
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:53,673
opportunity that is just phenomenal and
you should

784
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:58,180
think globally you know you need to
think about the distribution up your

785
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:58,095
game

786
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:01,170
as a global opportunity on

787
00:47:02,007 --> 00:47:06,386
now so the first thing that you should
do you if you haven't already done this

788
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:10,990
is to localize your App Store president
right

789
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:15,099
just so that when some a player in some
other region is coming in and looking at

790
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,163
your game it just stands to reason that
will be

791
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:22,080
more interested in it if they can read
the description and these other things

792
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:23,105
in their native language

793
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:27,090
rights to localize the name the
description

794
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:31,698
the keywords the snapshots and so on

795
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:36,663
right and then the second piece of this
of course is to localize the app content

796
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:38,460
itself

797
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:41,101
so by that I mean to you really go back
in structure

798
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:46,002
your game for internationalization you
need to do what you can to separate

799
00:47:46,002 --> 00:47:50,002
text from artwork I and textures so you
don't have to make

800
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:53,067
copies a big images for every language
that you support

801
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:56,144
and then go through you your you why I
and of course

802
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:00,903
right and translate the text in tall the
different languages the you want to

803
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:06,900
to support and finally you also consider
things like whether your game is right

804
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:07,047
to provide

805
00:48:08,028 --> 00:48:11,127
some cultural eyes content where would
be appropriate

806
00:48:12,027 --> 00:48:16,075
for example if it was a driving game
maybe you would use local road signs for

807
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:17,170
different locales and so on

808
00:48:18,007 --> 00:48:22,081
local license plates from different
locales

809
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:28,073
so now here's the list I've some other
languages that we've recommended

810
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:32,074
I before it's certainly not exactly
exhausted its a big less

811
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:35,117
I and it's a good place to start though
so

812
00:48:36,017 --> 00:48:39,696
for SES effects right English French
Italian German Spanish

813
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:44,880
then I many regions area in Asia upset
so Japanese Korean traditional and

814
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,143
simplified chinese:

815
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:49,067
them branches out from there so
brazillian Portuguese Russian

816
00:48:49,067 --> 00:48:53,099
Turkish and Arabic are what we would
recommend that you really put some focus

817
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,918
into

818
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:59,490
and there's a great resource online
developer tied up on a complex

819
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:00,638
internationalization

820
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,220
so this will take you step-by-step
through the process of

821
00:49:04,022 --> 00:49:07,621
internationalizing and localizing your
app your game

822
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:11,150
and it gives you some links the third
party

823
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:14,015
localization vendors if you don't have
that expertise

824
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:18,017
in-house but so that is number nine

825
00:49:18,017 --> 00:49:21,166
to localize I am so

826
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:25,260
number ten target the state-of-the-art

827
00:49:25,026 --> 00:49:28,075
so if you think about some of the best
games

828
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:32,152
that are on iowa's you are real common
thread as we've been saying is how they

829
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:36,071
consistently aim high and consistently

830
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:42,096
target the latest and greatest to
differentiate themselves on our device

831
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:47,235
so to be state-of-the-art means really
taking advantage of the capabilities of

832
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:50,145
the latest hardware like the a7

833
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,530
right and target the feature set up
those devices

834
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:59,822
so that you stand out I mean you guys
use all those demos yesterday

835
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:03,352
right during the keynote the state of
the union they were armed

836
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:08,650
this hardware you know you you've seen
what it can do

837
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:11,066
so take advantage a bad that power

838
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:14,164
that capability that's their

839
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:17,936
then hand in hand with that is that
state-of-the-art abs

840
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:22,811
support the latest versions apply a wet

841
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:27,430
and I think that this week should be
that turning point for you

842
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:31,054
words time now for you to realign your
project

843
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:34,078
to aimed for the release a bioassay and

844
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:38,103
API's and the frameworks that you'll be
learning about all this week

845
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:42,021
mm bring your minimum OS up to Iowa

846
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:45,620
7 that is our recommendations support
the latest

847
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:49,200
n and n -1 so when I was

848
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:54,101
8 is released you probably want to be
looking at seven and eight

849
00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:57,390
K now something in you know

850
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,076
something that we do hear from
developers actually more often than you

851
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:01,090
might think

852
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:04,037
I'm is that they're telling us that
they'll stick there's

853
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:09,053
deciding to stick with an older version
of Xcode are in order a CK

854
00:51:09,053 --> 00:51:12,058
because they think that if they move up
to what's latest

855
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:17,792
they won't be able to still chippy game
that supports anything older than that

856
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:20,843
but obviously thats not the case

857
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:25,062
so you can adopt the latest SDK version
by setting your base SDK

858
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:29,455
what is current and then setting your
deployment target down to the lowest

859
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,348
a OS version that you want to support
and

860
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:38,611
dropping support for the rest and then
handle differences between 7-8 in your

861
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:39,410
code

862
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:42,095
you know check for the existence of
hardware capabilities

863
00:51:42,095 --> 00:51:46,126
or check whether classes are defined or
check whether classes respond to a

864
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:48,054
particular selector

865
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:52,120
and so on now for those of you who are
coming over to Iowa esiner just not

866
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:56,100
as familiar with that process we
actually went through it all in

867
00:51:57,018 --> 00:52:01,041
pretty good doubt when we went out for
our I was seven Tech Talks

868
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:06,068
I last november december I am so those
videos are online our developer web

869
00:52:06,068 --> 00:52:10,070
sites you should check them out

870
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:13,079
then also stated the art games for the
ones that integrate with our built-in

871
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:16,191
game technologies

872
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:20,040
as jeff talked about boo

873
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:24,052
so we're providing just this incredible
foundation for you

874
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:27,117
was built on a lot of different API you
know likes bright kid

875
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:32,022
Game Center Open GL seeing and game
controllers and so on

876
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:36,726
and the new API's like metal and seeing
kid on iowa's

877
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:41,357
right and these are just a few the
technologies you know this

878
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:45,650
but the point I wanna make is about the
other things

879
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:48,534
you know the tools and the API's that
are available to you as

880
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,390
game developers is comprehensive on
iowa's

881
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,043
and you should learn the entire stack

882
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,088
oh my god has a lot of learning to do
were really what I mean is to

883
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,830
familiarize with yourself with the
technologies that are

884
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:09,750
on iowa's rather than just taking a
project that you were working on

885
00:53:09,075 --> 00:53:12,374
maybe on another platform or on an order
OS version

886
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:17,020
and just shifting mad over and fitting
it into the equivalent

887
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:20,069
your target should be to go for the
latest and greatest

888
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:24,428
target the top target the
state-of-the-art target the a7 target

889
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:25,680
iowa's

890
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,089
eight and its capability right

891
00:53:28,089 --> 00:53:31,096
rather than just coming over and just
spitting and

892
00:53:31,096 --> 00:53:34,465
with an older something that's older

893
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,356
but so that's number ten target the
state-of-the-art

894
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,920
before I finish I do have one more thing
that I wanted

895
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:44,126
talk about so yet let's save you

896
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:48,117
done alternatives right you fix your
onboarding

897
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:53,706
your he chewed up your core loop your
optimizer localize just a the art

898
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:58,861
Sarah of that so where do you go from
here

899
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:02,750
yeah well go to 11

900
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:05,122
really give it that extra push

901
00:54:06,022 --> 00:54:11,022
go the extra mile his here is my
observation about this

902
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:14,641
you know we heap innovating we keep
enhancing our

903
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:18,990
game technologies we have this thriving
ecosystem

904
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:23,146
right where we're investing were adding

00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:21,151
building games and there are a large
number game in the App Store we're

918
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,056
talking about how you can make

919
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:28,058
your game standout it isn't good enough
to just go up and I i've great idea

920
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:32,080
score game on a caught up in the App
Store and see what happens be it is a

921
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:33,027
very big pond

922
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:37,155
so use what alan is told to use these
ten steps and use the 11th step

923
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:41,152
really make your game shine these are
the things

924
00:55:42,052 --> 00:55:45,057
which may not be apparent when you look
at it may not be apparent when you look

925
00:55:45,057 --> 00:55:45,101
at the

926
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:50,008
design award winners that they do these
things but they really do they spend a

927
00:55:50,008 --> 00:55:51,010
lot of time

928
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:55,029
cut the rope was great example spent a
lot of time I'm going through

929
00:55:55,038 --> 00:55:58,052
with people who have played the game the
foreign say pay

930
00:55:58,052 --> 00:56:01,058
what what do you when you approach the
game what you need to know

931
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:05,089
is not to fly guy came to open in an
hour so take the time with your game

932
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:09,097

the time to adopt these 10 items
