increase happened and this is great and
offers more value

144
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:39,445
for the people on the App Store it's a
single install to get

145
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:44,807
all is a great app that once we've
included in this complete my bundle

public in its green shot a preview
that's what categories rating

156
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:23,425
marketing URL's privacy earl's all these
different pieces as we won't make this a

157
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:24,088
simple

158
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,100
as possible for you and we realize that
we have a lot to this information

159
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:31,076
already so start with information that
is

160
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:34,089
specific to the bundle its bond on its
own name

161
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:39,031
need a description about the bundle
obviously it has on price

162
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:42,143
has on skew and

163
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,057
marking your also you can market the
spinal on its own

164
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:50,316
the rivers information that comes from
the first app

165
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:55,110
with Becky ap the first after this
bundle

166
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:59,240
so the first screenshot will come from
that app the first at preview

167
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,426
you see in the App Store come from that
app the categories

168
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:09,480
your bundle will match that the first
app and after contact information after

169
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:09,141
the information

170
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:15,097
all that we pulled from the first app is
well as well as the privacy URL

171
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:18,163
the rest of the information

172
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:22,632
from your money will come from all the
absent a bundle

173
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:27,800
if you have three APs that are four plus
and one app is $12 plus

174
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:31,016
your bundle will be rated 12+ for if you
want rebuttal to be made for kids

175
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:39,006
all of the app's and bundle must be made
for kids threat to the screenshot an app

176
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,490
reviews

177
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,628
will come from the other apps your
bundle equal share for every app in your

178
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,540
bundle

179
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:47,093
and for keywords will take

180
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:50,562
all the keywords from all the app's in
the bundle and apply those

181
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,690
you don't have to reenter any new
keywords but take a look and see how we

182
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,070
do it on iTunes Connect

183
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,318
we come back to my apt page

184
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,120
we click new app bundle

185
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:08,231
first thing we want to enter as our

186
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:15,339
new app on a name talking toy box we
start selecting the app's

187
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,041
at this point I realized K the first app
is important its key

188
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,062
so I know which 41 my app bundle

189
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:28,109
but I would like to make this one that
primary ap

190
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:34,020
that's like my apt I can now see

191
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:37,024
I my screenshot have already been
popular for me

192
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,065
from that first app I can fill in

193
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:43,073
the app bundle description the marketing

194
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:46,106

00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:50,070
scroll down further any deflect

196

197
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,089

bundle

198
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,153

then the rest information has already

199
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:02,134
been filled in

200
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:07,123
categories the rating I'm good to go at
this point I'm done I've created by

201
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:08,092
Apple

202
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:11,159
I made it is a minute one thing to
remember with that bundles

203
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,110
is that once they've been submitted the
app store you can change the apt and a

204
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,048
bundle

205
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:19,153
the immutable wanna make

206
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:24,080
a bundle with now five after six after
service for than just creating a bundle

207
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:28,036
meant that to the App Store here's a
look like on the App Store

208
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,056
you can see your app-icon you can see
all the app's and the bundle

209
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:36,082
that a preview screenshots come down
below

210
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,134
him up to 10 paid aP's

211
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:44,093
and Apple you have to give that
discounted price

212
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:48,116
the first preview and screenshot come
from the first

213
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:52,038

220
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:18,107

221
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:22,024
really excited today to show you what
we've been up to

222
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:26,043
before we get into it talk about what it
takes to build a great out

223
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:29,116
we're all here this week to learn tips
and tricks on building a great app

224
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:35,095
we know it all starts a great idea every
app it's in the store today that she's

225
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:35,169
great success

226
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:39,155
starts with a great idea how do you
capture that and present bad

227
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:43,101
to your customers you doubt thoughtful
design

228
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:48,019
pixel perfect design intuitive design
you focus on really

229
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:53,110
concrete flows that make sense your
customers we write 13 code we all here

230
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:55,005
right but free code

231
00:14:55,014 --> 00:15:01,050
worked on my device we testing testing
testing more

232
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:05,031
so we have automated unit test I'm a DUI
tests were gonna talk more about

233
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:08,122
our beta testing services well this is a
really important part

234
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:13,097
writing and creating a great app finally
we submit to the store

235
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:16,191
these are all pieces develop a
responsibility that were familiar with

236
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:17,167
today

237
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,115
and Apple does a fantastic job
supporting you throughout this process

238
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:25,071
great schools with Xcode more great
tools and services were talking about

239
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:25,119
today

240
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,072
but we know that our job is not done as
developers

241
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:32,121
13 summit to the store there's this
whole new set of responsibilities

242
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:36,030
we're not all done and

243
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:40,045
this is after launching this is what app
analytics is all about these new

244
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,090
responsibilities

245
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,105
can influence this chart hopefully if
you have absolute store

246
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:48,098
this chart is familiar to you you have
your downloads over time

247
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:52,167
it's increasing and you see point to
acceleration over time as well

248
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:56,113
let's talk about what it takes to
influence not and why app analytics is

249
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,016
really important so first

250
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:03,033
our app store presence we can see on
this chart now I have that

251
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:06,039
orange dot my see that App Store
presence really

252
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:09,160
canned influence my downloads

253
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:13,089
abstr present is your name your
description

254
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:19,079
your keywords we have these albinos now
we also have or App Store previews

255
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,176
these are great ways to get your out to
have more downloads more customers

256
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:26,078
morton people using your out marketing

257
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,142
once you have a great app you want to
get the word out as developers

258
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:33,069
we don't just come into the store with
committed to our social networks we send

259
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,104
it to our friends and our family

260
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:38,079
we create a home page has she seen
newsletters markings are really

261
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,171
important piece

262
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:42,144
new updates when you're building an
application

263
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:48,137
and submitted to the store your
customers crave new content

264
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:53,042
new levels new ways to engage

265
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:56,090
existing customers in new ways to
attract more customers you're out me

266
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:00,075
stay fresh and unique and to do that you
go through this constant release

267
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:04,077
and build cycle

268
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:08,101
Nexus advertising advertising and
marketing often used in the same

269
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:12,018
same vocabulary that advertises a little
bit different

270
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:16,070
as a developer you may choose to pay for
or advertising and that's a big decision

271
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:19,052
you want to know if it was worth the
advertising investment

272
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:23,074
you got it nice return on that app
analytics is there to help you

273
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:27,155
inform those decisions

274
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:31,062
all these dots all these wines you want
to monitor

275
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:35,026
measure and see how they're changing
over time

276
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:38,103
an app analytics is there to provide
those answers and that is why

277
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:43,008
we use app analytics because Apple X
provides answers

278
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:47,092
it helps you answer questions like house
map doing

279
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:50,156
our people returning to my app

280
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:55,113
our people converting on here in app
purchases

281
00:17:56,013 --> 00:18:00,098
app analytics helps you make good
advertising decisions

282
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:02,106
and this is what I'm really excited
about app analytics helps you reveal

283
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:04,125
missed opportunities

284
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:08,112
without penalty if you can see that your
app store presence is greatly United

285
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:09,095
States

286
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:12,108
and a lot of customers are looking at
your apt United States

287
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:17,082
actually turning into real customers as
opposed to potential customers

288
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:20,126
the same may not be the case in Germany
with

289
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:25,053
app analytics we can see that the
potential customers in German Germany

290
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:28,144
can become actual customers if we focus
on our German house for presence

291
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:33,068
localization really understanding the
German culture and understanding that

292
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:36,107
marketing to Germany maybe a completely
different

293
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:40,013
different animal and we can do that with
our app store presence

294
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:43,072
now panel X 1.0 those areas

295
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:46,108
finally after we launch it's all about
building a better route

296
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:50,054
an app analytics is there to tell us and
point us in the right direction to do

297
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:50,151
that

298
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:56,124
that is why Alex's important

299
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,116
so with that how we look at this Apple
how are we looking at ap Analects is a

300
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,037
product or service

301
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,071
for app developers we're focusing on
this concept a

302
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:09,116
the customer life cycle and this
involves acquisition to engagement we

303
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,024
want US developers to be covered from

304
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:15,072
the point rapid the store to the pointer
customers are using Yap

305
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,119
let's look at that from the customer's
perspective we start with our first

306
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:19,068
measure

307
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:22,085
here is your app store product page we
have trip guider

308
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:26,086
nap we made up for this presentation the
first thing we see

309
00:19:26,086 --> 00:19:29,111
iOS App Store use really excited for the
first time

310
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:33,108
Apple's providing you developers with a
view a viewer app store views

311
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:40,032
all tench active

312
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:43,050
this is data on the Apple can provide
come straight from the App Store

313
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:46,072
to you developers next we have

314
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:50,035
ap units and sales the state here

315
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:53,122
attract any time potential customer
turns into an actual customer

316
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:57,030
and touches your buy button inside your
product page you have a stated today and

317
00:19:58,002 --> 00:19:58,047
felt

318
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:01,114
and trends if you're familiar with
iTunes Connect but this is different

319
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:05,038
were time this data into a complete
picture with abstract use

320
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,137
the first time you can see your App
Store views and how that drops

321
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:12,071
for out units

322
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:15,137
max we've combined app store data
Billings data

323
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:20,071
and now we have device data we have
installs

324
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,144
a customer purchases your application
but they may install it on multiple

325
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:24,113
devices

326
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:30,019
this is why I installed an app units are
two different to differ metrics

327
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,058
want your customer install the
application starts engaging

328
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:36,060
we have a new world with device measures

329
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:39,025
we have sessions active devices

330
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,128
we have retention have this concept
stickiness as well

331
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:46,081
sticking this is great it's a single
measure that you can track over time

332
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:49,084
to ensure that your both growing and
retaining customers

333
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:55,020
there's one measure you want to look at
stickiness

334
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:59,026
finally if your application has been a
purchases we track that as well

335
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:02,110
the first time you can see the entire
customer lifecycle from the point the

336
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:03,072
user

337
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:07,145
became a real customer to when they're
converting on an app purchases

338
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,077
concept about urself to using

339
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:15,092
any business intelligence today he may
be looking at average revenue per user

340
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:18,166
this is average sales we provide that
this in combination with sticking asking

341
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,135
so you really powerful story

342
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:25,096
how he raps doing and how your customers
are performing

343
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:28,175
such the customers view this let's look
at your view the developer

344
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:32,124
we have our app store reviews we have
our app unit

345
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:36,028
active devices retention in app
purchases this final

346
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:39,125
starts to drop in that make sense
because not every potential customer

347
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:43,096
becomes an actual customer

348
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:46,105
was just look like when we start to ask
more questions house

349
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,058
look by platform we start to filter this
data by

350
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,116
iPhone iPad iPod Touch we can see the
composition

351
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:59,090
a bar after views across all the Apple
platforms

352
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:02,024
you can also answer that App Store
presence question

353
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:07,056
should I be localizing for Germany here
I can see my app store reviews in europe

354
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:10,141
quite high but my app units in Europe a
little lower

355
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,066
and this makes sense as well and there's
an opportunity there this is where

356
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,128
analytics can help you

357
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:19,119
reveal missed opportunities if we just
localize rap

358
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:23,057
potentially making it more apt units and
that will help us get

359
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:26,123
more active devices more retention more
and I purchases

360
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:31,038
maybe it's that simple and we don't have
to release another version number out to

361
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:31,081
get

362
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:34,157
more downloads in Germany

363
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:38,152
this is great let's talk about what it
actually looks like I'm sure you guys

364
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:42,150
what we've been working on I think
that's why we're here

365
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:47,064
app analytics shows up as a new feature
inside the new iTunes Connect

366
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:51,030
here beside my apt

367
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:54,022
first few that we see when we click
inside and the latex

368
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,136
is are out west this is the old reviewed
your entire mobile business

369
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:02,068
here I can see my trip guide a rapid the
top I can see all of my other app

370
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:05,074
my sweet can see filters

371
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:08,090
I can see the ability to change my time

372
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:12,037
my date let's look at these metrics so
here's the key by dole's

373
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:17,055
for an application going from the left
to the right I see that life cycle again

374
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,062
it's consistent

375
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:21,159
start with maps reviews on the map units
I see my sessions

376
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:25,059
and myself

377
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,113
see if they're rising falling in this
period

378
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:33,017
hover over these I get toward tips
telling me with the previous period was

379
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:34,054
as well

380
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:37,117
ecoFLEX one selecting one of these
brings us into the heart this product

381
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,104
which is our metrics page

382
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,090
first thing you'll notice is that great
trend we can see how we're doing

383
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:43,036
overtime

384
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:47,062
in this situation we're looking at data
from a I can see

385
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:50,130
all remain at my application is increase
in App Store views

386
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:55,011
which is awesome can also change my
interval below I can change is from days

387
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,102
to weeks to months

388
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:02,029
talk about those measures again here I
have those life cycle metrics I have my

389
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,031
sales

390
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,143
my store data I have my engagement date
on my device data

391
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:10,058
conflict any ideas and change the chart

392
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:14,117
let's look at breaking this down by
particular platform as like you buy

393
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:18,018
now I can see how this actually looks

394
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:21,037
across all the Apple devices like see my
iPhone

395
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:24,044
phone my iPad my ipod touch and it looks
like

396
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,070
the trend is about the same on all been
there all perform an equally in this

397
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,030
case it's great

398
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:32,157
but a customer can't have and iPhone and
iPad

399
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:36,094
the same time they're not same device
they're two different devices

400
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:39,129
so we look at that as a stacked area I
got a chart type

401
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:45,029
as Lex stacked area that I can now see
the composition

402
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:48,122
a iPhone iPod iPod Touch and some of
these were equal

403
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:53,025
a hundred percent whatever metric and
looking at there's different chart types

404
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:56,099
for different scenarios and looking at
App Store views

405
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,145
here yet area what's the best will
choose the sensible default based on the

406
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:03,139
measure you looking at

407
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,040
what's what to another measure okay App
Store units

408
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:10,107
here there's no issues here Analytics is
providing an answer that

409
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:14,091
my conversions from pageviews ap units

410
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:17,097
hasn't dropped drastically its a little
bit lower

411
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:20,138
but the trend is the same and on that
both devices the same

412
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,113
so not a lot of opportunity to improve
my iPad

413
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:28,049
App Store presence because it's
performing the same as my iPhone maybe

414
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:30,052
I'm prove them all together

415
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,113
go to another measure in app purchases
and this is

416
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,061
where our team decided that on may 15

417
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:41,066
we would lower the price in app
purchases as a result we got a lot more

418
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:46,059
app purchases that occurred and we can
see that would happen Alex

419
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:49,088
see despite their we can see that across
all platforms

420
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:54,133
performed much better as a result of our
change

421
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:59,080
we also had intuition that change in our
in our purchases

422
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:02,012
would help give more customers more
content

423
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:05,155
and that would result in more engagement
more active devices

424
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:09,112
so with that we select in app purchases
compared to

425
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:14,020
reflect active devices and now

426
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:17,008
we see are active devices one up had
dinner and a person I can see these

427
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,051
layer on top of each other

428
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:23,087
telling me the story that yes are
changes to in app purchases really did

429
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:23,096
impact

430
00:26:24,077 --> 00:26:28,084
active devices as well we've got more
revenue from a nap purchases

431
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:34,129
and we've got more retention more
engagement from our active devices

432
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,032
such metrics and that's the measures
that we provide

433
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:41,103
there's some questions we haven't
answered yet

434
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:45,067
and we can answer that was sources what
are sources

435
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:49,079
sources are all about how people finder
app

436
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,112
as developers you work really hard on
your map your app store presence

437
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:57,028
and you have no idea right now how
people are getting to your app's per

438
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:57,111
page

439
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:03,066
we're excited that sources solves that
problem first two types

440
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:06,144
we have a website we have campaigns

441
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,136
web sites are really simple with the
link to your App Store page: you're

442
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:11,117
familiar with these links today

443
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:16,031
anytime you have a link to your friends
your family market insights

444
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:19,089
that link is now trapped in for mobile
website as a refer

445
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:22,163
source and we can see that map analytics

446
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:26,126
in campaigns on that same link with the
campaign I D

447
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:30,084
this is a friendly link friendly name
that you supplied to the URL

448
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:33,145
let's talk about what that looks like
three simple this is the URL that

449
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:37,063
hopefully you're familiar with

450
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:42,131
we had a provider ID we get this
provider ID inside iTunes Connect

451
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:46,085
and then you add your campaign ID
friendly name you want as friendly as

452
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:48,144
possible because you're going to view
this name

453
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:54,046
afterwards we'll show you that in a
second inside your sources list

454
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:57,090
if you're using I add today to advertise
your application

455
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,095
this is automatic you do not have to go
to I add and setup

456
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:04,133
campaign names for the purposes about
analytics

457
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:08,102
it will all happen seamlessly any
campaign create Naiad will be

458
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:11,008
automatically trapped in available

459
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:15,057
inside app analytics and you can really
see the effectiveness a bad

460
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:18,083
inside appena lakes without any effort

461
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:22,139
so what does this look like come here we
select sources

462
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,039
again brought to the source is less here
I see my top web sites

463
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,042
miss I doubt I can see top campaign I
have the same key by Dolce

464
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,096
that I had in my application list as
well we're really trying to

465
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:37,192
reinforce the story about position to
engagement and keep it consistent for

466
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:41,113
you guys

467
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:45,032
and flat top campaign to get brought
over to my talk campaign last

468
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:49,054
these are a view of all those friendly
names that we set up

469
00:28:49,054 --> 00:28:52,059
zoom in on one of these here I can see
spring email blast that was my family

470
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:53,073
name

471
00:28:53,073 --> 00:28:57,118
I see maps reviews my units my sales in
my sessions that same

472
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:01,092
life cycle this is great we select that

473
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:04,095
and we're into this source details we
think that

474
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:07,113
if you're marketers you're gonna love
this page are gonna sit on this page and

475
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:10,051
share with your colleagues

476
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:13,140
we can see all those key measures and
nice visual we see a broken down over

477
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,023
time as well

478
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,144
every day has a bar on these key
measures we also see additional measures

479
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:19,123
that you can only get

480
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:23,116
on them metrics page

481
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:27,032
you can see this broken down by
different data types as well so

482
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:30,057
here we're looking at maps were abused
by regen by territory

483
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:34,059
by platform changing those drop downs I
can change the measure that i'm looking

484
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:34,132
at

485
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:38,104
see exactly how this campaign is
performing how this website is

486
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:39,099
performing

487
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:44,185
and what exactly the customers are doing
as well

488
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,154
so that sources we think that you're
gonna love sources today

489
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:52,090
you know that people are downloading
you're out installing the app you don't

490
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:53,015
know is whether coming from and

491
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:58,038
were solving that problem so we've
answered the question

492
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,085
how are people doing the app they can
bring on an app purchases

493
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:05,069
where they coming from we have an answer
in detail

494
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:09,091
our people returning are they retained
what does that say to life cycle look

495
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:09,157
like

496
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:14,090
and we answer that with retention just
do a quick

497
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:17,033
education on retention why it's
important this is

498
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,073
obvious a hundred percent of your
customers our customers on the purchase

499
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:21,158
date

500
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:26,064
it's really simple moving along

501
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:29,072
45 percent our customers on day two

502
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:33,096
35 percent on day 7 and 20 percent and
8:30

503
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:37,096
hopefully these numbers are scary but
there's an opportunity there

504
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:40,128
you can get them higher in hiring you
focus on this is really important

505
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:44,057
because if you have no more customers a
day 30 or 90

506
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:47,099
you're really gonna may have to focus on
the next stop

507
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,171
or improving your contact your marketing
to get more

508
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,075
how we show this new UI we select
retention and I can see

509
00:30:56,011 --> 00:31:00,014
my purchase date on the left May 23rd

510
00:31:00,014 --> 00:31:03,017
I can see my days later on the right
here i'm looking at

511
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:06,097
day 7 as a little story

512
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:10,097
so up the active devices the purchase on
May 23rd

513
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:14,111
18 percent remain active seven days
later

514
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:19,038
this great single view of how by
retention on May 23rd was doing

515
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,052
as developers as marketers prague
managers

516
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:25,058
we want to look at this with oliver
purchase States stacked on top of each

517
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:26,066
other

518
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:30,120
so that's the view we're providing in
same May 24th

519
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:35,014
and now we show you the rest this matrix
so may 2013

520
00:31:35,032 --> 00:31:38,036
June 3rd I can see my retention stacked

521
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:43,081
single quick view of how my desk the
seven retention is

522
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:46,115
and you don't have to do anything this
is amazing so

523
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:54,015
we're providing

524
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:59,054
metrics sources retention your app list

525
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:03,071
what do you need to do nothing there is
no STK

526
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:10,071
no third-party code running in your
app's no performance degradation

527
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:16,107
you don't have to write any new code
this is not a Apple provided library

528
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:17,104
that you have to

529
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:21,046
in bed in your app you don't have to
instantiated initialize it

530
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:26,093
no code is required no app updates
required you do not have to recompile re

531
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,120
sign recently route to the store

532
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:32,049
you really have to do nothing to take
advantage of this

533
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:35,143
we're doing this because it's all built
into the App Store and Iowa State

534
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:41,044
everything from the store metrics to the
sales metrics to the device metrics is

535
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:45,052
all automatic in the app's when I was
eight

536
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:49,049
and what we kept in mind while doing
this privacy

537
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,090
app analytics has been every really
highly requested feature and

538
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:55,091
iTunes Connect we're excited to bring it
to you guys were excited to bring it to

in this business

541
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:04,126

business to rate informative blog posts

analytics as a service to developers and

this product

547
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:23,126
as this product rules out the privacy is
at the forefront we're not making any

548
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,034
compromises in this area

549
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:29,041
we're really excited about that we think
that's a really unique thing

550
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:33,072
that we're offering filing maybe the
best news

the setup time nothing love the cost

557
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,144
we're excited about this feature that
like to bring up Daniel

558
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:03,059
to talk about Test Lite beta testing

559
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,155
thanks Kristin hi my name is Daniel meow

560
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:10,107
the software engineer and i cant connect

561
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:15,008
now most have you heard Durrington keen
on Monday that we're announcing

562
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:19,079
just like this well we're very excited
to have this opportunity today

563
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,093
to bring you more details about this
great feature now

564
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:28,137
before we get started have your views
Tesla in the past

565
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:33,102
great well whether you use test flight
or not

566
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:37,341
I'm sure we can all agree that great

567
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,740
beta testing tools go a long way

568
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:44,087
we'd all like to see less obvious

569
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:47,576
and more the so

570
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:52,700
before you go into the details let's
talk a little bit about the history of

571
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,008
their distribution

572
00:34:55,008 --> 00:35:02,008
in the beginning beer distribution look
a lot like this

573
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:07,094
whenever you want to test your app on
your device you connect your device to

574
00:35:07,094 --> 00:35:07,165
your computer

575
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:13,014
transfer your binary over contest from
there at some point

576
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,730
you probably decided may be helpful to
have others

577
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:20,125
also take a look at your app before you
publish it to the App Store so each time

578
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:22,071
you want at a tester

579
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:27,126
you ask the tester for the device UDID
you got the developer portal

580
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:32,067
data provisioning profiles and then you
would send

581
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:36,216
your tester your the binary they would
connect their devices to their computer

582
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:41,920
transfer the binary over and it was star
testing course you have to do this for

583
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:42,154
every single one of your testers

584
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:46,145
so what do we do for you during this
period

585
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:50,119
how did we change your beta distribution
experience well

586
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:58,019
we went from this to this

587
00:35:58,044 --> 00:36:02,092
we think we can do better with a new
test liberia testing platform

588
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:05,168
you can distribute your app not one

589
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:13,068
not a hundred not 500

590
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:27,001
but up to 1,000 testers either testers
not devices

591
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:34,036
in fact you to your testers contest on
multiple devices

592
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:40,051
next

593
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:47,051
you didn provisioning profile you no
longer need to worry about these

594
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,110
all you need to get a Tesla started is
an email address let's talk a little bit

595
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:03,052
about the two sides if

596
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:07,072
the new platform you start out in iTunes
Connect

597
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:10,146
as you work on your project you upload
your build iTunes Connect

598
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:17,082
from iTunes connecting amenities build
manage the testers

599
00:37:17,082 --> 00:37:20,084
distribute these builds to your testers

600
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:23,089
and other testing

601
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:30,089
can come back to get inside into their
activity know what your testers receive

602
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,107
an invitation

603
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,125
to testify I mean to test your app

604
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:39,033
they download the test flight

605
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:43,092
I was at and from here they can manage
what at they want their testing

606
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,163
they can perform one tap installed an
update

607
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:50,116
and they can send your feedback

608
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:54,032
so

609
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:58,051
well we're working on these features we
discover that

610
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:02,126
building great app requires a flexible
process everything from

611
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:08,054
interning with your development team to
distribute a wider audience so we came

612
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:09,055
up with

613
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:13,079
internal in beta testers no internal
testers

614
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,087
I mean I figure I can connect users beta
tester

615
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:25,106
as anyone with an email address you can
have up to 25 internal testers

616
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:30,028
and up to 1000 beta testers

617
00:38:30,028 --> 00:38:33,123
as you upload build

618
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:37,031
to iTunes Connect your internal testers
will have

619
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:43,058
access to these bills right away and
better app review will be required

620
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:47,079
for you to unlock a thousand testers
while you're building review

621
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,113
you continue to upload new build and
your internal testers can contain a test

622
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:59,013
and you can get you to manage it has and
i cant connect finally

623
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:04,037
sandbox account as he could be a tester
signs into the EIA what's up

624
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,137
for the first time go on a Mac we have

625
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:12,071
a sandbox account created for them what
this means is that

626
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:15,157
you don't need to come and i cant
connect anymore to create account we

627
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:17,095
want your testers will attest

628
00:39:17,095 --> 00:39:20,137
all aspects of your application
including in app purchases

629
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:24,128
so let's see what this all looks like

630
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:28,084
here we are

631
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:31,150
we're back on the version pager the you
i cant connect

632
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:37,083
you know it's a pre-release have will be
quick this

633
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:43,054
will feel mister the bills that we've
upload in Xcode float so you wanna test

634
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:47,139
bill number 103 in order to do this we
first have to enter meta-data

635
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,102
protesters so they have something to see
when they receive their habitation

636
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:55,008
we click

637
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:59,089
into this bill we enter things like a
description

638
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:02,097
we also tell the tester what we like in
the test

639
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:09,096
specifically on this bill after we've
had this information

640
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:14,159
inputted we hit say ever come back to
build

641
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:20,127
13 on the Billboard we come to the
corner

642
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:25,042
we could protesting switch turn on
testing

643
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:28,107
and that build is now available to our
internal testers

644
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:32,082
what they want upload

645
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:35,130
another built for internal testers keep
carrying

646
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:40,005
maybe upload one more

647
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:46,009
now we're confident that 105 is a bill
that we want distribute more broadly to

648
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:46,096
our beta testers

649
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:51,082
in order to do this we click the submit
button

650
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:55,181
next to the bill and after review

651
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,138
this is now also available for beta
testers

652
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:04,039
you notice here that there's a
thirty-day 30-day exploration

653
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:07,060
on this bill so we know exactly when we
need to upload the next bill

654
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:12,022
protesters now second

655
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:19,076
take a look at managing beta testers
here we are on a beta testers with

656
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:24,114
we see everybody that we've added 24
invited

657
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:29,062
we see what they're doing we can see
that some protesters have installed the

658
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:29,095
app

659
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:32,107
and they're already testing some have

660
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:36,062
accepted the invite but they haven't
installed yet

661
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:39,134
and some other not even accepted the
invitation via

662
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:45,075
for the ones who have installed we see
the latest bill that they've installed

663
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:48,082
everyone to add another tester

664
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:55,071
we can't hear the top click the plus
button

665
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:58,080
at a few email addresses it's a minute

666
00:41:58,008 --> 00:42:01,053
and it has a ready to go

667
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:05,114
so that I can connect sign now let's
take a look at the tester experience

668
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:10,063
in Iowa here we are on the device

669
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:13,079
this is the Mail app and this is an
invitation that we received from a

670
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,082
developer

671
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:18,014
we see the name that app that we're
we've been invited the test

672
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:24,085
we see it link that says open test
flight what's going to happen

673
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:30,139
here we are the test light up from here
we can install app

674
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,086
and what we've done that we can just are
testing

675
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:39,092
few things to note here send feedback
link

676
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:46,092
you as a tester can tap this to send
feedback to develop providing

677
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:49,134
there's also the what the test section
which we talked about earlier the

678
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,041
developer telling us

679
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:57,078
what they like as a test specifically on
the latest bill

680
00:42:57,078 --> 00:43:01,121
now if we tap the test flight link in
the top corner

681
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:05,087
this will take us back allister app that
we're actively testing

682
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,136
from here we can open any of the zaps we
can take a look at the what it has no

683
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:15,115
we look at the version that we're
testing

684
00:43:16,015 --> 00:43:19,093
not go back to the home screen for a
minute here we see that that we've

685
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:20,187
installed and we'll see a bad

686
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:24,174
and little orange bag next to the name
of the app

687
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:28,101
that we have just installed this
indicates that this app is currently

688
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,058
being tested

689
00:43:30,058 --> 00:43:33,096
the Beta Beta bill the via

690
00:43:33,096 --> 00:43:36,187
0 for begun a vacation

691
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,170
with a telling us that there's a new
bill develop a protest

692
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:44,062
so the top that

693
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:48,062
but take us back into the app and a test
flight

694
00:43:48,062 --> 00:43:52,157
from here we can uppity up

695
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:56,101
and we're on our way

696
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:01,083
and that's test flight the EIA what's up

697
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:05,167
so in summary we have up to a thousand
testers for each other APs

698
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:09,159
with their testing we no longer need to
manage

699
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:13,114
you the ID's or provisioning profile

700
00:44:14,014 --> 00:44:20,043
we can perform one tap installs and
updates

701
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:23,140
sandbox account automatically created
for us to

702
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:27,068
for testers to build a test in app
purchases

703
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:33,022
and is on you test flight out for Iowa

704
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:36,030
and that beta testing

705
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:43,003
activity

706
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:45,065
alright thank you Daniel

707
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:49,122
very few things to wrap up here before
we conclude

708
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:54,047
every year we ask after view if you had
a few

709
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:57,926
tips and tricks we can give to
developers at the developer's conference

710
00:44:58,349 --> 00:44:59,350
what would they be

711
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,190
after you did a great job I look right
before I got on stage

712
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:07,042
ninety-four percent of all updates
review within five days

713
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:11,731
and here are some suggestions I can help
pitcher up their app review

714
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:15,970
number one apt name versus keywords

715
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:19,726
your apt name is not the place to list
all those different words that you want

716
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:22,540
people to search on so they can find

717
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:27,120
your app that's what keywords for idea
Bay

718
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:32,002
if you serve ads ads must be present in
your

719
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:36,064
the description and screenshots

720
00:45:36,082 --> 00:45:40,148
must match your app and I would add to
this app review will probably on the

721
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:41,120
fourth next year

722
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:45,131
when you're ready to commit and a
purchases

723
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:48,810
for view you need to make sure that all
aspects their purchase work

724
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:51,114
if you need a service up and running
said other renewables work

725
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:55,953
danny's re ready now when you to
purchase is life

726
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,900
on the App Store but when you submit it
after view every app get metadata

727
00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:00,978
rejected

728
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:05,230
and used to meet again without making a
change

729
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:09,114
for that matter data it will just get
rejected a second time I say that

730
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:11,067
because they say it happens

731
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:15,131
just a friendly no as always makes you
have

732
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:19,035
rights for all the content the keyword
in your app

733
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:22,074
this would apply to screenshot app
reviews

734
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:26,054
anything and lastly testing

735
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:31,133
I'm very happy that this has Lori
Saldana with this year

736
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:35,150
one thing I've noticed is that

737
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:38,092
if you're going iPhone app in East also
work

738
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:42,149
iPad not to be outdone

739
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:46,092
that mission teams that hey we have some
suggestions want help

740
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:50,011
give people some things to think about
before they submit the app to app review

741
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:55,890
IDFA again answer his questions
correctly in iTunes Connect

742
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:59,800
you serve ads accusing idea pay makes
you

743
00:46:59,008 --> 00:47:03,023
answer those questions right way get her
number about

744
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:07,097
delivered within I have all the right
icon sure all the required icons

745
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:13,694
are in your project before you submit
tool chains and bad signature

746
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:18,640
these kinda invalid binary messages can
all be solved by making sure the you

747
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:21,070
upload in crate your ap and the

748
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:25,026
latest version of Xcode and Mac App than
boxing

749
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:29,097
if you can if not a Mac app to the App
Store makes you check that box in Xcode

750
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:33,100
before doing so a low note but

751
00:47:34,027 --> 00:47:38,079
iTunes Connect for Iowa how many have
you already gotten the latest update we

752
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,103
released a few weeks ago

753
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:43,072
this is our first for rare step into the
redesign

754
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:48,128
updated pages cells and trends take a
look at your

755
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:53,125
five weeks due to weaker twenty six
weeks information

756
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:57,032
new page view

757
00:47:57,095 --> 00:48:01,754
I can factor I alaska Palmer and you can
release the latest version live into the

758
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:03,130
App Store

759
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:08,040
so today we talked about

760
00:48:08,004 --> 00:48:12,009
the new design for iTunes Connect a
knife

761
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:16,053
new UI as well as some cleaner flows app
reviews

762
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:20,030
fifteen to thirty seconds I've dynamic
video

763
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:26,092
so you can show what makes your at
