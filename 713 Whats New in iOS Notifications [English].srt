1
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,055
afternoon everybody

2
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:19,056
hi so my name is Dan Curtis I today

3
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:22,102
my colleague Rick Dickson and I will be
talking about what's new and I was

4
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:23,098
notifications

5
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:27,130
Nyassi so I before getting told a great
new features a bioassay

6
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,032
with lay down some foundation about what
notifications are

7
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:36,062
and how you've been using them in Iowa
seven today so

8
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:39,125
when I mention notifications I'm
actually talking about two different

9
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,030
types and notifications really

10
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:44,168
we've got user notifications and we got
family notifications

11
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:48,114
so what sort of abuse or notifications
what are these

12
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:53,093
so using notifications are really just

13
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,303
things that the user can interact with
see or hear

14
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,100
on their device and they're coming
directly from your app

15
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,495
so for instance with the Messages icon
appear on the top left hand corner the

16
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:05,350
screen

17
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:08,444
what say that these are happy to receive
a message from one of their friends

18
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,030
when the app is currently not in the
foreground what we've got three

19
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:12,952
different options

20
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,032
up for using notifications that we could
use to let them know that there's new

21
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:16,587
information

22
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:21,420
first one that we could do is badge the
app icon

23
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,116
having that little red circle with the
number one in their informs the user

24
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:28,055
that they've got a one new message now

25
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,044
for times that the user happen
throughout that device in your pocket

26
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,581
and they might not be able to see the
screen

27
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,550
we could instead playing found all

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,684
informing the user that they've got a
new message and lastly

29
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:47,550
we have alerts which ticked down as a
banner from top of the screen

30
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,128
with a little preview message what that
message actually campaigns

31
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,537
so that these are not even have to a tap
on the Messages icon

32
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:58,970
to check out what's there so we have bad
as we have sounds

33
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:01,386
we have alerts and for alerts

34
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,200
they can actually appear in different
forms in different places as well

35
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:09,009
depending on how the user happen to set

36
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:12,081
other settings for your app in the
notifications under settings

37
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:15,130
are these alerts that are being those
banners that tick down and then go away

38
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:16,088
automatically

39
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:21,068
they could appear as model alerts the
stayed up there on the screen to these

40
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,111
are happens interact with them

41
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:27,107
and then we also have alerts that they
could be displayed in the Notification

42
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,016
Center drag down

43
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:33,044
as well as for the time that these are
happen have the device in your pocket

44
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:37,052
and the screen was of when they happen
receive an alert next time they turn it

45
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:37,105
on

46
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:42,076
waiting right there form in the lock
screen so

47
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:46,105
where do these notifications come from
well for use in notifications they can

48
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:47,060
come from

49
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:51,019
to different places I first thought they
could be coming directly from your app

50
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:54,147
that is your app uses you I local
notification API

51
00:02:55,047 --> 00:03:00,054
to present a notification to the user
alternatively

52
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:04,100
are you can also have user notifications
that are triggered in response to remote

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,038
push payloads you can EP in a server the
about their on the Internet

54
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:12,046
in coordination with the Apple Push
services you send

55
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:18,083
a push payload that defines in this case
and AlertNet ok

56
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,095
sorry that result in Miller

57
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:24,151
up on the a double appear up on the
screen now

58
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:28,148
I got a little builder eager there we've
also got another typing notification

59
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:32,087
I mention we had user notifications and
family notifications

60
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,129
silent notifications they are just push

61
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:39,062
payloads that are sent from your EP in a
server but instead of

62
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:43,095
I presenting a user notification like an
alert for sound

63
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:48,172
or a bad on the screen I US when it
receives that push with said wake up

64
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:50,085
you're up in the background

65
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:53,149
that Europe can do some background up
background

66
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,049
image processing for information
processing this case

67
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,056
your app is fetching content from server
so that the next time user happens to

68
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,060
tap on your app icon

69
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:07,059
bring into the foreground that
information is there and ready

70
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:11,452
so nobody has to weigh for loading
spinner to complete know that other

71
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:12,010
stuff

72
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,038
that notifications in Iowa 7

73
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:18,427
got user types we've got silent types
user

74
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,240
I notifications can come from locally on
the app I

75
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:25,106
remote notifications they can only be
coming from

76
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:29,043
push payloads so let's talk about

77
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:33,049
the new features a bioassay
notifications

78
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:36,052
we're gonna be talking about for create
new topics today

79
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:40,058
offer some gonna be talking about using
notifications what's changed about them

80
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:43,116
in Iowa State specifically with
registration

81
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,031
then read is gonna come up and he's
gonna talk about a great new feature

82
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,108
notification actions these are those
interactive notifications

83
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:56,053
to make europe interactive even without
it being there on foreground and scream

84
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,059
number gonna pass the baton again I'm
gonna come back talk about remote

85
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:00,105
notifications

86
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:04,101
some changes that we have their for
registering

87
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,004
then finally we're gonna talk about one
last new feature location-based

88
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:09,086
notifications

89
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:13,113
user notifications that are triggered in
response to the user changing their

90
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,015
location like Iran

91
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:21,132
to the very first topic using
notifications

92
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:26,088
so in I will see regardless of whether
your app is going to display remote

93
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:27,153
user: notifications

94
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:32,137
or local user notifications Europe must
first register

95
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:38,073
to use those notifications in this is
going to result in a lil in an alert

96
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:41,129
that is going to be presented to the
user asking them if it's okay P wrapped

97
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:42,097
the present

98
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:46,826
notifications to them so what does this
code look like how do we register

99
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,210
your app you were to take advantage
abuse or notifications

100
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:55,056
the code is actually pretty
straightforward the very first thing you

101
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:57,915
need to do is to clear the types of
these notifications

102
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,930
you wish to present from within your at
this case the sap is actually going to

103
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:02,097
present

104
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:06,072
all the different types notification to
possibly can it's going to be showing

105
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:06,153
badges

106
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:10,075
on the icon loss to be playing sounds

107
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:14,138
as well as displaying alerts now once we
decided the types that were actually

108
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,057
going to be presenting

109
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:20,094
we're gonna create are you are using
notification settings object

110
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:24,073
passing these types the settings for
types categories

111
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,580
now but second parameter the categories
parameter Hill no definite no here

112
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:31,064
don't worry about it that has something
to do with notification actions

113
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:36,053
rats gonna talk about those later
finally once we've created the settings

114
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:36,140
object

115
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:40,080
we're just gonna pass it to the shared
application instance in registries

116
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:44,037
notification settings

117
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,586
and at that point assuming this is the
very first time your app is called this

118
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,040
method

119
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:53,088
the user is going to be displayed an
alert asking them if it's okay

120
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:56,096
for your apt to present user
notifications to them

121
00:06:57,068 --> 00:07:00,113
now they're gonna they're gonna say okay
or maybe not now

122
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:05,017
but no matter what they do they could
always at a later time back on the rapid

123
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,077
change the preferences and settings

124
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:10,143
so this isn't the last time I that you
have a chance in order to present

125
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:14,100
notifications to the user

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,024
so once they've actually replied to that
alert your

127
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:21,423
app delegate is gonna get a call back
application

128
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,720
did registry is a notification settings
that notification settings object that

129
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:26,076
we pass back to you

130
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:30,028
represents the user's up to date most
current

131
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:34,227
preferences for displaying notifications

132
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,532
and at that point all you need to do is
check what types in notifications you're

133
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,270
allowed to present to the user

134
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,100
so again like I mentioned before there
is the possibility that the user could

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,053
always background your app

136
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:50,138
going to settings and change their
preferences any stay on topic this

137
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,050
you don't wanna be doing any unnecessary
processing per se preparing

138
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:59,024
a alert tight notification when you
don't really need to

139
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:03,091
so we have a PI in UI application as
well

140
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:06,183
this current user notification settings
method

141
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:11,091
that is available in the UI application
instance will give you the most

142
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,220
up today user notification preferences

143
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,130
and from there you can make sure that
you're not doing any

144
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:21,072
unnecessary work to prepare for
notifications that are going to be

145
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:25,113
displayed to the user anyway

146
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:30,078
so that use notifications are really
it's just a registration method to state

147
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:33,627
that your app wishes to use user
notifications

148
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:37,424
and to do this you just need to call
registry. is a notification settings on

149
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,287
the UI application shared instance

150
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,086
anytime you need to get the most current
user preferences

151
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,190
you just have to call current
notification settings on UI application

152
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,698
in order creepy settings are jacks at
the time of registering

153
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:55,300
you just call settings for tights
categories

154
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:59,152
your college for the categories was nil
in the previous sample slide

155
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:02,454
and that has something to do with
notification actions

156
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,980
Saretsky to come up on stage and talk
about notification actions a great new

157
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:06,247
feature in iowa say

158
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:13,740
I can't wait to see you guys take
advantage of affect

159
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:17,733
thanks then my name is red Dixon and I'm
gonna talk about notification actions

160
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,484
a great new feature I was a that we're
really excited about

161
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:28,230
firsts let's talk about notification
actions and I was seven

162
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:32,102
but on the lockscreen Notification
Center

163
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,600
banners or more alerts

164
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:38,995
you get one default action when you
swipe a tap on the notification

165
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,594
the launch the application in the
foreground

166
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,350
and I West 8 in addition to that
defaultaction

167
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:51,714
when you swipe to the left on lockscreen
you get to know actions

168
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,490
likewise the Notification Center when
you swipe to the left

169
00:09:55,049 --> 00:10:00,748
to new actions in banners when you pull
down

170
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:07,197
to more actions and more alerts when you
tap on the Options button

171
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:10,850
you get up to former actions

172
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:14,544
so you sort of occasion actions in your
application unit follow three steps

173
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:18,368
you need to first register your actions
you need two seconds

174
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,910
send a push for schedule local
notification

175
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,250
and finally once the user has seen these
actions and tapped on one

176
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,300
need to handle the action

177
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,039
to illustrate the steps and then use the
calendar invite example

178
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:38,066
with reactions except maybe and decline

179
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,660
let's first look at registering actions

180
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,545
you start off by creating our action

181
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:51,174
he then set the identifiers interaction
the same identify we passed back to you

182
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:54,410
when you handle the action

183
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,086
you then set the title this is a
localized string they'll be shown to the

184
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:59,135
user

185
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,048
you then set the activation mode this
will determine

186
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:06,110
if your application is launched in the
foreground or the background

187
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,290
if you need to show you why his shoes
for ground you don't need to interrupt

188
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,456
the user

189
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:14,920
mission said jews background if you do
run in the background

190
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:19,061
you have on the order of seconds not
minutes to run

191
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,730
he then said whether the action is
destructive if this is yes

192
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:28,662
the actual be shown as red on the lock
screen and the Notification Center

193
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:32,360
finally set whether authentication is
required

194
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:36,675
if this is yes and the device is locked
these will have to enter into passcode

195
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,350
when the tap on the action

196
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:42,042
interaction as a background action is
important to note that the device does

197
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:43,036
not

198
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,495
actually unlock secure application
accesses any files on

199
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:50,850
desk need to be sure that they belong in
the crack data protection class

200
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,153
for more information and data protection
will point you toward some

201
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:58,410
more resources at the end of the session

202
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,710
so here's an example if the except
invite action

203
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,083
it does need to show you I so it can run
in the background

204
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:10,125
its not destructive SoCon on blue in
Notification Center and on the

205
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,224
lockscreen

206
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:15,220
and because accepting an invite is
relatively harmless units require

207
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:17,085
authentication

208
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:20,172
on the other hand if you had a trash
male action also doesn't need to show

209
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:21,135
you I

210
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:25,073
so I can run in the background it is
destructive

211
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:29,052
so will be shown in red on the lock
screen in Notification Center

212
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,160
and because you want someone to be able
to pick up your phone and delete all

213
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:32,805
your email

214
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:35,987
authentication is required

215
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,351
finally we have reply actions this

216
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,608
does need to show you why so we'll need
to run for ground

217
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,187
again it's not destructive so will be
shown as blue

218
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:50,110
and because it's a foreground action if
the device is locked the user will have

219
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:51,950
to enter enter passcode

220
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:57,980
so in this case the authentication
required property has no effect

221
00:12:57,098 --> 00:13:01,154
so now that you've to find her actions
need to group them into a category

222
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:06,503
a category is simply a type of
notification with associated actions

223
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:10,030
for example you can have the invite
category with except maybe in decline

224
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,404
actions

225
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,930
you don't have a new male category with
marks reading trash

226
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:20,271
where take category with like comment
and attack

227
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:25,876
start using no categories the first
create one

228
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:29,327
you then set the identifiers will
include the side in the fire

229
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,676
in apush payload your local notification

230
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:37,565
you then set the actions on the category
for inaction context

231
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,733
there to action contacts the first the
default action contact

232
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:46,006
supports up to four actions the second
the minimal action context

233
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,547
is used when there's only room for two
actions

234
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,110
the for example if you said these three
actions except may be in decline

235
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:58,080
for the default action contacts and if
this notification was then presented on

236
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:00,192
lockscreen

237
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:03,354
you would see the first two actions
except maybe

238
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,844
if you wanted a different set of actions
such as except in decline

239
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:11,910
you could set those on the minimal
action contact

240
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:15,123
then when this notification is presented
on the lockscreen

241
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,122
you would see except in decline when the
same notification

242
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:23,251
is presented as a modeler because this
is the default

243
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:29,548
action context you would see the fourth
reactions except may be in decline

244
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:33,447
22 finder categories you now need to
register them

245
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,720
you do this by first grouping them
together in a Sat

246
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:44,061
providing them to your user notification
settings the sword and left us off

247
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,797
and then registering those settings with
a shared application instance

248
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,612
now average their actions the next thing
to do send a push notification

249
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,895
or schedule local notification to show
those actions

250
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,666
in the remote notification case unit
include the category identifiers

251
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:05,543
in their push payload will use this to
determine what actions to show when you

252
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,433
present your notification

253
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,867
roth a very excited to announce that the
previous size limit have 256 bytes for

254
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,470
push payload

255
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:20,006
has now been increased 22 kilobytes

256
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:26,520
compare

257
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:26,116
so in the

258
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:30,077
local notification case you create a
notification is normal

259
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:35,114
you then set the category of the actions
you like shown

260
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:39,113
family is scheduled of cation as normal

261
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:46,092
wants you sent to push notification or
scheduled local notification

262
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:50,121
and these arrests in this and tapped on
an action if any to handle that action

263
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:58,021
to handle the default action when a user
to swipes or taps on a notification

264
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:03,083
launch application in the foreground and
call application did finish watching

265
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:03,160
with options

266
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,045
will pass in the local notification or
the remote notification

267
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,183
the remote remote notification case will
also call

268
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,089
application did receive remote
notification that completion handler

269
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:18,094
if your application is

270
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:21,159
already in the foreground we won't
actually show the notification

271
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,063
instead will either call

272
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:28,150
application did receive local
notification or application did receive

273
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,021
remote notification

274
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,155
with its completion handler if you've
been permitted that otherwise will call

275
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:34,096
the fair

276
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:37,151
at the version without the completion
handler find me

277
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:43,076
to handle the new additional actions and
I was 8 you need to implement at least

278
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,139
one of two new methods and application
delegate

279
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,104
in either case

280
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:54,053
will pass to the action identifiers you
can use this to determine what action

281
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:54,130
was tapped on

282
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:59,038
of the past few

283
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:02,139
either the remote notification or the
local notification

284
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,106
and you can use this to I retrieve any
information you need to handle that

285
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:08,057
action

286
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:14,070
family will pass you the completion
handler

287
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:17,020
which you must call when you finish
handling the action

288
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,086
for the summer I S

289
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:25,164
to use notification actions in your
application you first need to register

290
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:27,065
your actions

291
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:31,081
this involves defining your actions
ripping them into a category

292
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:34,120
and in registering those categories with
you use a notification settings

293
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:39,013
you then need to send a push
notification

294
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:42,075
or schedule local notification including
the category identifiers

295
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:47,130
the actions you like shown you then need
to handle the action with these are has

296
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:51,080
tapped on it by implementing one of the
new methods on your application delegate

297
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:55,009
notification actions are a great new
feature

298
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:57,122
we can't wait to see what you're going
to do with them I'm not gonna pass it

299
00:17:58,022 --> 00:17:58,100
back to dan

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,006
to talk about remote notifications pay

301
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:06,007
on fourth talk about what's new

302
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:11,063
with remote notifications in iowa say so

303
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:14,074
recall we got two different types to
promote notifications

304
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:18,142
we have user type remote notifications
that's when European a server

305
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:23,091
sends a push notification to the device
were in the payload we've gotten this

306
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:25,107
case an alert that results

307
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:29,102
any user notification being presented to
the user as it was coming from

308
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:33,008
the ap its running are installed right
there on the device

309
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:36,067
we've also got silent types

310
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:39,111
government notifications this is when
you're APNs

311
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:43,107
server is sending a push notification
with the content available flag

312
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:48,063
contained in it and then instead a bus
presenting a user notification

313
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:52,096
I on the device instead ilsa is gonna
come in

314
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:56,155
weekly wrap up in the background you can
go and fetch whatever content that needs

315
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,130
to or do whatever info processing is
necessary

316
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:05,034
that when the user next launch the app
all that info is right they're ready for

317
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,070
them to ingest

318
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:09,038
so

319
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:13,097
for user notifications that our source
from remote payloads

320
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:16,136
on just like for local notifications

321
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:21,082
you must make sure that your app calls
register using notification settings

322
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:25,153
before any alerts or badges for sounds
are actually gonna be presented

323
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:29,120
by you will need to also register for a
more pushes

324
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,040
more show how to get into that later I

325
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,154
now for filing notifications just like
in Iowa seven before

326
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:40,056
you need to I to find your info Key West
file

327
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:44,112
are you white background mode iraq and
that are a must contain an entry

328
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:50,089
remote notification and so user
notification family notifications these

329
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,168
are not mutually exclusive

330
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:55,102
Europe actually can use both i mix and
match them

331
00:19:56,002 --> 00:20:02,031
to whatever makes most sense for your
users NP rap

332
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:05,052
so for remote notifications are you must
make sure

333
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:08,105
that you are registering before you can
receive any pushes from European a

334
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:10,098
server

335
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:15,117
now in Iowa 7 I win you would register
for remote notifications

336
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:20,072
you would ask the user for permission
but now since we have separated the

337
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:23,096
concept registering for user
notifications which does require

338
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,125
permission

339
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:29,028
from remote notifications that could be
UserType or silent type

340
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,097
we actually are opting your app's into
being able to receive remote

341
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,193
notifications have any payload type

342
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:37,137
by default however keep in mind

343
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:42,124
%ah okay for have

344
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,111
banks I keep in mind however that these
are could anytime

345
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:52,018
going to the Settings app and change the
preferences

346
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:55,114
so how do we actually register for
remote notifications

347
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:59,066
in Iowa seven before we ask you to call
this

348
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:02,130
method here register for remote
notification types

349
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:06,030
that's now deprecated because we've
changed the way

350
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,070
we define user notifications and remote
notifications

351
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:12,012
all you need to do is calling you
application

352
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:15,152
register for remote notifications

353
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:20,146
now again this wall op love your apt to
receive remote payloads that are coming

354
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,053
from the APNs server

355
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:27,070
but if you want user notifications to be
presented in response to those payloads

356
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,010
if you've got say

357
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:32,159
an alert defined in those payloads you
also must make sure that you call

358
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:38,136
register user notification settings as
explained earlier in the talk

359
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:42,063
so once you've called register for
remote notifications

360
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:46,154
as well as optionally register user
notification settings

361
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:50,136
your app delegate needs to implement
application did register for remote

362
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:52,041
notifications

363
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,082
with device token the factually isn't
new API

364
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:58,114
this is something that has existed 907
previously

365
00:21:59,014 --> 00:22:02,058
I just letting you know that you still
need to implement this for handling

366
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:04,061
remote notifications

367
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:08,142
what this call back does is a provides
your app with the device token

368
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:12,118
were once you receive but token you need
to go and pass it off

369
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:16,081
tear EPNS ever your call

370
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:19,167
you need to make sure that you've always
got the most up-to-date device token

371
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:24,093
registered with your EPNS server
otherwise pushes may not make their way

372
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,150
to the user's device

373
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:29,100
so in the case but these are happened to
disable I your app from using remote

374
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:30,136
notifications

375
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:35,102
or for any other failure case recalled
that the app delegate

376
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:39,048
also needs to implement application did
fail to register for remote

377
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,095
notifications affair

378
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:45,097
and at this point all you need to do is
take that dare object process it

379
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,100
appropriately

380
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:50,091
make sure you disable any logic within
your application that hymns of a

381
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:52,119
perceiving remote notifications

382
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:56,100
you don't want to be doing any
unnecessary processing within your app

383
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,055
for notifications aren't going to be
coming at disgracefully

384
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:03,111
to grade

385
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:07,017
so that's what's new with remote
notifications on IRC

386
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:11,055
again I just like before you do have to
register for remote notifications before

387
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,129
you can actually receive them

388
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,035
I however now in IRC

389
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:20,039
the user will be opted into being a 4

390
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,073
receiving a remote notifications and
they could go into settings later in the

391
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:25,136
feebleness

392
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:30,104
however does still require you to call
this registration API

393
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:34,038
while the PPIs change we've simplified
it I N

394
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,132
have named register for my notifications
you can call their on the UI application

395
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:39,126
shared instance

396
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:43,090
call so let's get into the last topic up
today

397
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:47,028
location-based notifications something
we're very excited about we've been

398
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,068
working with the core location team for
this feature

399
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:53,119
very happy to talk about it today so

400
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,019
let's say that you've got a nap

401
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,045
and you want to notify the user when
they happen to arrive at some certain

402
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,104
geographic location

403
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:07,082
so the users on their device and they
happen to wander into that area and you

404
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,082
wanna show say

405
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:12,096
an alert what you could do this in Iowa
7

406
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:15,173
them before but it required a lot of
hoops to jump through

407
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:20,132
and also could make for some a confusing
user experience

408
00:24:21,032 --> 00:24:25,059
Nyassi however we've streamlined this
API

409
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:31,100
all it is is simple additions on top at
the UI local notification API class

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,082
and what you can do is define core look
Asian region objects

411
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:41,181
and attach them to the notification so
that the notification of fire when the

412
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,850
user happens to

413
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:45,157
coming year enter exit region

414
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:49,153
now you can make it so that these
notifications are presented only the

415
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:53,055
very first time that these are happens
into this region

416
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:57,155
or you could have a fire always if that
makes sense for your app

417
00:24:58,055 --> 00:25:02,071
and again census features so tightly
integrated with core location

418
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:06,530
I does require little bit of colour
location registration on your part

419
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:10,770
let's take a look at what that
registration code is before we get into

420
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:11,139
how we can actually schedule

421
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,132
these notifications so here we are

422
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:23,032
I what we need to do is create a
co-location manager instance

423
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:26,145
then we just need to set the delegate on
this manager the delegate is going to

424
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:28,049
receive call backs

425
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:32,094
notifying whether your app is allowed to
were not allowed to track users

426
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:35,101
locations

427
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:41,001
then finally in order to enable these
location-based notifications

428
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:44,008
on the location manager incense you need
to call request when in use

429
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:45,164
authorization

430
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:49,137
so what does this mean when in use
authorization

431
00:25:50,037 --> 00:25:54,049
essentially if the user says OK will
allow your app to track the user's

432
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:54,127
location

433
00:25:55,027 --> 00:26:00,065
or know about the user's location when
your app is running in the foreground

434
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:03,134
however recall these notifications are
going to be appearing on the user's

435
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:04,041
device

436
00:26:05,004 --> 00:26:08,080
even if you're app is in the background
were suspended

437
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:11,077
and they might be able to see these
alerts well that's okay

438
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,060
because even if your app has been
disabled for core location

439
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,062
and even if the user is seeing those
alerts your app won't be receiving any

440
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,019
call backs

441
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:23,748
until these are actually interactive
hurdler in Europe is still allowed

442
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,610
to track the user's location so we're
requesting or when in use authorization

443
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:29,096
from CL location manager

444
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:32,133
assuming this is the very first time
that the that your app is called this

445
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:33,120
code

446
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:37,044
the user is going to be presented with
the permission alert

447
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,106
just basically saying is it okay for
this app to track your location

448
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:45,115
when it's running for gramm notice
however in that alert we've got that

449
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,330
usage tax stamp allowing smaller font

450
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:51,104
this is actually something that our apt
has to find on its own

451
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:56,101
and you need to make sure that your apt
the fines this usage tax as well

452
00:26:57,001 --> 00:27:00,033
so to do that in your info pls

453
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:03,086
a file hopefully this makes easier to
read

454
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:07,145
I'm we've got and its location when you
see is this description

455
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,330
just gotta find the ski the values gonna
be a string

456
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:16,055
and this is the actual usage tax that's
going to appear in that alert

457
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:19,107
are recall however that if your app is
running in different locales in

458
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,032
different languages

459
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:24,079
you need to make sure that this string
is localized appropriately for all those

460
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,135
other languages

461
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:29,134
so make sure that you define values for
the street up for this key

462
00:27:30,034 --> 00:27:34,080
in urine popular strings file as well
now we've asked the user if it's OK

463
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:37,097
for your app to track your location when
it's running the foreground

464
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:42,103
now we actually need to handle the call
back from CL location manager

465
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:46,098
and to do this your I your managers
delegate

466
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:50,109
is going to receive this call back
location manager

467
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:54,046
did change authorization status: that
point all you need to do

468
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:58,055
it's just make sure the status is the
when in use status

469
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:02,102
if you're authorized for tracking the
user's location when in use

470
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:06,053
and at that point you can start
scheduling his location base

471
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:07,058
notifications

472
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:13,085
so how do we actually schedule these
location-based notifications

473
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:17,089
take a look at some sample code how we
could skip our schedule notification

474
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:20,098
that triggers in response to the user
entering the region

475
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,172
very first thing you need to do just
like any other UI local notifications

476
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:25,127
that would

477
00:28:26,027 --> 00:28:30,048
otherwise be triggered by it the for a
time you first go to create an instance

478
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:32,053
the view I local notification

479
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:35,151
in to find what type of notification
this is going to be

480
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:39,115
in this case we're just saying this is
going to be an alert when user happened

481
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:41,031
sent to that region

482
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:43,640
assuming the app isn't running the
foreground they're gonna get a little

483
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,910
pop up saying

484
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:47,124
hey you have arrived

485
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:51,109
then specific to region type core
location type

486
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,063
user I you I local notifications

487
00:28:55,063 --> 00:29:00,080
were stating here that we only want this
notification to trigger the very first

488
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:00,072
time

489
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:04,137
these are happens to enter exit this
region now this is actually the default

490
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:05,043
behavior

491
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:09,182
so it's a little bit sharper superfluous
here however you could set this to know

492
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:16,123
if that makes sense for your users and
for your app

493
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:20,702
next you just need to create a field
region instance

494
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:24,860
and set it on the region property at the
UI local notification

495
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:27,088
so in this case for defining feel
circular region here and we're just

496
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:28,079
giving it some

497
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,081
arbitrary cornet with some radius so
that when the user enters the circle

498
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:35,137
arm this a notifications gonna be
triggered

499
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:39,045
however I did say that this is a seal
region property

500
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:42,088
see you can also use feel beacon regions
or any other type of seal region

501
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:43,150
subclass

502
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:48,008
if you want to find out more about how
you can use caller location

503
00:29:48,008 --> 00:29:51,061
especially in combination with you I
local notification

504
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:58,129
I've got some resources to point you
towards at the end of the stock

505
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:02,080
finally a new UI application shared
incense you just need to cost schedule

506
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,013
local notification

507
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:07,022
passing this notification just like you
would any other

508
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:11,049
UserType local notification

509
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:14,111
so call now we've actually got this
notification scheduled

510
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:19,019
assuming that your app is running in the
background or suspended rather

511
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:22,104
end-user happens enter into that region
they're going to be presented with an

512
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:23,893
alert

513
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,780
saying hey you've arrived at your
destination in your app can handle that

514
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:28,129
local notification

515
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:32,045
in the application did finish launching
with options

516
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:36,024
alternatively if your app is running in
the foreground and user happens

517
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:39,690
enter into that region your app delegate

518
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:41,158
is going to be called back with
application did receive local

519
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:44,072
notification

520
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:47,133
so the two different our method here
application did finish launching

521
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:51,109
verses application did receive local
notification the logic is very very

522
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:53,022
similar

523
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:57,071
let's just take a look at the latter Sat
for the latter part

524
00:30:57,071 --> 00:31:00,160
so we've been informed that the user is
entered into a region

525
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,053
are or rather that the user has received
a local notification

526
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:09,050
and we wanna check whether this is
actually a region-based notification

527
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:12,033
while you I local notification has a
region property now

528
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:16,157
to see if that region happens to not be
male

529
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:20,114
an IFS in if it isn't we've got a
location-based notification

530
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:23,103
and we can do whatever makes sense tell
all the user's friends where they've

531
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:26,082
arrived

532
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:31,101
so that's location-based notifications
it's very very simple API that added on

533
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:34,014
to you I local notification

534
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:38,543
and it's so simple because we've
integrated directly with core location

535
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:42,690
however because we've been together with
us this week or location

536
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:45,105
are we do require some core location
registration logic

537
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:49,053
now again I this is all

538
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:53,080
as well about keeping the user's privacy
first place in mind

539
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:56,057
so if the user happens with ever
disabled your app from being able to

540
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,113
track

541
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:01,077
their location even when your app is in
the foreground you're not going to be

542
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:04,160
receiving call backs like application
did receive local notification

543
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,017
4 location-based notifications

544
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:12,077
these are my launcher app in response to
an alert that was presented at the local

545
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:14,089
be our location this notification

546
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:18,107
but still your app isn't going to know
that and that was a lot of stuff that we

547
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,032
talked about today

548
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:24,087
on biggest thing we've been talking
about that notification actions wrecking

549
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:26,176
appear talk about this great new feature
for IRC

550
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:30,108
so psyched to see you guys use it making
your app's

551
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:34,082
interactive even when they're not
running the foreground really

552
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:37,178
new in powerful ways I some simple
changes

553
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:41,102
behind user and remote notification
registration

554
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:46,035
I again we separated the concept of
having to register for different remote

555
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:48,064
notification types

556
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:52,110
and instead ask you to register for that
user notification types

557
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,320
that Europe is going to use and then we
had

558
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:59,740
location-based notifications integrating
tightly with core location

559
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:02,086
to schedule user notifications

560
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:06,355
in response to the user entering or
exiting regions

561
00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:11,950
South a lot of stuff on and we've got
great resources for you guys check out

562
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:14,169
Paul gambled his our core OS
technologies evangelist he is a great

563
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:15,548
guy

564
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:19,610
in you can send him letters at ample
that Apple dot com

565
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:23,083
I we've also got documentation at
developer DAP about.com

566
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:26,432
while the DEP forms talk to like minded
developers I

567
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,201
find out how other people are using
these great new features ask your

568
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,610
questions get them answered

569
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:35,079
by but by this is WWDC

570
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,698
and we've also got other sessions now
the sessions happen previously

571
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:42,860
what's new in poor location as well as
taking carlocation: indoors happened

572
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:42,177
yesterday

573
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:47,104
but these are available online as well
as protecting the user's data

574
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:52,075
ret hinted at that data class protection
well in 2012 we had a session on these

575
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:52,159
as well

576
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:56,083
and you can check out these videos
online too

577
00:33:56,083 --> 00:34:00,104
so you guys been great thank you so much
for coming to da WWDC

578
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:02,343
hope you have a great nephew
